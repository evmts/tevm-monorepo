The input type will have autocomplete but still is widened to accept the ethers type. The return type is extremely difficult to override to being generic

This class actually doesn't use Tevm at all and is meant to be upstreamed to ethers.js

### Patch Changes

To use the latest main branch release install with `@main` tag. e.g. `npm install @tevm/ts-plugin@main`

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#438](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/438) [`eedb7e0`](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/commit/eedb7e0e8f853acf59c3f86c1d7317bad8ee7e2b) Thanks [@roninjin10](https://github.com/roninjin10)! - Improve peformance by 98% (5x) testing against 101 simple NFT contract imports

  Major change: remove bytecode from Tevm. Needing the bytecode is a niche use case and removing it improves peformance of the compiler significantly. In future bytecode will be brought back as an optional prop

  This improves peformance by 98% (50x) testing against 101 simple NFT contract imports

  Because Tevm is still considered in alpha this will not cause a major semver bump

### Patch Changes

- [#442](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/442) [`b020298`](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/commit/b020298f1acbfad396b0c1c9a1618e00bc750a43) Thanks [@roninjin10](https://github.com/roninjin10)! - ⬆️ Upgraded all npm packages to latest
  Every package in Tevm is consistently updated to it's latest version using `pnpm up --latest`

### Minor Changes

- [#390](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/390) [`eabdb46`](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/commit/eabdb466582000b0964d87d65da72f93dc4702d2) Thanks [@roninjin10](https://github.com/roninjin10)! - Added new @tevm/ethers package for typesafe usage of Tevm with ethers in https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/385

  ## High level overview

  Previously the best way to get typesafe [contracts](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/contract/) with ethers was [typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain) typechain improved the dev experience of using contracts via creating typesafe contracts via codegen. Tevm builds on this idea by providing the same benifit purely at runtime without any build or codegen steps.

  - `@tevm/ethers` exports a single function `createEthersContract`
  - `@tevm/ethers` only supports ethers v6 at this time

  ## Installation

  To use `@tevm/ethers` simply set up tevm as normal and add the special `@tevm/ethers` package

  ```
  npm install @tevm/ethers ethers@6
  ```

  ## API Reference

  ### createEthersContract function

  **Type**

  ```typescript
  function createEthersContract<
    TAddresses extends Record<number, Address>,
    TAbi extends Abi
  >(
    contract: Pick<
      TevmContract<any, TAddresses, TAbi, any>,
      "abi" | "addresses"
    >,
    options: CreateEthersContractOptions<keyof TAddresses & number>
  ): TypesafeEthersContract<TAbi>;
  ```

  **Description**
  Creates a typesafe [ethers contract](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/contract/) from an tevm contract. This function provides typesafe contracts for Ethereum development with Ethers.js and Tevm.

  **Params**

  - `contract`: This parameter should be an Tevm contract. It should include the 'abi' and 'addresses' properties.
  - `options`: This parameter should be an object of type `CreateEthersContractOptions`. It should include either a `chainId` or an `address`, along with the `runner`, which should be an Ethers.js provider or signer.

  **Returns**
  The function returns a `TypesafeEthersContract`. This contract is a typed version of the ethers.js contract instance, which provides type safety and autocompletion for contract methods.

  **Example**

  ```typescript
  // import a contract with tevm
  import { ERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
  import { providers } from "ethers";
  // create a provider or signer for the ethers contract
  const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider("http://localhost:8545");
  // create a typesafe contract
  const contract = createEthersContract(myContract, {
    chainId: 1,
    runner: provider,
  });
  // enjoy typesafety and autocompletion in your ethers contract
  const balance = c.balanceOf("0x32307adfFE088e383AFAa721b06436aDaBA47DBE");
  ```

  ## CreateEthersContractOptions Type

  **Type**

  ```typescript
  type CreateEthersContractOptions<TChainIds extends number> =
    | {
        chainId: TChainIds;
        runner: ContractRunner;
      }
    | {
        address: Address;
        runner: ContractRunner;
      };
  ```

  **Description**
  An options object type used by `createEthersContract` function. It can either provide a `chainId` if Tevm config has addresses for contracts configured for that chain or provide the `address` prop to specify the address directly. Both options require a `runner` property which is an Ethers.js provider or signer.

  **Params**

  - `chainId` or `address`: You should provide either the chainId or the address of the contract. If you use the `chainId` option, Tevm should have the addresses for contracts configured for that chain. If you use the `address` option, specify the address directly.
  - `runner`: This is an Ethers.js provider or signer.

  **Example**

  ```typescript
  const optionsWithChainId = { chainId: 1, runner: provider }; // Using chainId
  const optionsWithAddress = { address: "0x1234...abcd", runner: provider }; // Using address
  ```
