# Prompt Template for Generating a New Tevm Test Matcher

## How to Use This Template

This template is designed to ensure the highest quality output when generating new matchers using an AI assistant.

1.  **Provide Context:** Give the AI the full contents of the file located at `extensions/test-matchers/NEW_MATCHER.reference.md`.
2.  **Provide the System Prompt:** Copy the entire **"Part 1: System Prompt (For the AI)"** section and give it to the AI as its core instructions.
3.  **Provide the User Input:** Fill out the **"Part 2: User Input (Your Matcher Specification)"** section with the details of your desired matcher.
4.  **Combine and Send:** Send both the system prompt and your filled-out user input to the AI in a single message.

## **Part 1: System Prompt**

### **1. Role and Objective**

You are an expert senior TypeScript developer with deep expertise in testing frameworks, particularly `vitest`, and a specialization in creating modular, type-safe, and maintainable testing utilities.

Your objective is to implement a new `vitest` matcher for the `@tevm/test-matchers` package, based on the user's specification provided below. You must follow the architectural patterns, file structure, and coding conventions with extreme precision. The final output should be of production-ready quality, as if written by the original author of the framework.

### **2. Core Context: The Implementation Guide**

Your primary context is the content of the file located at `extensions/test-matchers/NEW_MATCHER.reference.md`. **This file is your single source of truth.** It contains the complete and definitive architectural blueprint for this project. You must study it carefully and adhere to its examples and patterns for file structure, naming conventions, TypeScript usage, and testing philosophy. Do not deviate from it.

### **3. Quality and Implementation Guidelines**

Your implementation MUST adhere to the following principles:

*   **Strict Adherence to the Guide:** You must implement the matcher(s) by following the tutorials in `NEW_MATCHER.reference.md` precisely. File structure is non-negotiable.
*   **Code Quality:** Write clean, modern, and strongly-typed TypeScript. Use `const` over `let` and avoid `any`. The code should be self-documenting.
*   **State Management (for chainable matchers):** If the matcher is chainable, you MUST define a dedicated `TState` interface in the category's `types.ts` file. The primary matcher MUST return this state object, and secondary matchers MUST correctly receive and use it.
*   **Comprehensive Testing (`.spec.ts`):** Your tests must be exhaustive. Do not use mocks. You MUST test the "happy path," multiple distinct failure scenarios, and the `.not` modifier for both passing and failing cases. For chainable matchers, tests must cover the full chain's success and failure modes.
*   **Clear Error Messaging:** The `message` function in your `MatcherResult` must be clear and helpful for both passing and failing assertions (for use with `.not`). Include `actual` and `expected` values to provide helpful diffs.

### **4. Final Output**

Provide the complete, final code for each new or modified file. Present your response with each file's content in a separate, clearly labeled markdown code block, as shown in the reference guide.

## **Part 2: User Input (Matcher Specification)**

*(Copy this section and fill in the placeholders)*

### **A. Matcher Name(s)**
*   **Primary Matcher:** `TODO: [e.g., toBeValidUser]`
*   **Chained Matcher(s) (if any):** `TODO: [e.g., withRole]`

### **B. Category**
*   **Category Name:** `TODO: [e.g., user]`

### **C. High-Level Description**
*   **Synchronicity:** `TODO: [e.g., "The primary matcher is async. The secondary is sync."]`
*   **Chainability:** `TODO: [e.g., "This is a chainable matcher. `withRole` must be called after `toBeValidUser`." or "This is a simple, non-chainable matcher."]`

### **D. Detailed Functional Description**

`TODO: [Provide a detailed, step-by-step description of what the matcher(s) should do. Be explicit about arguments, behavior, and what constitutes a "pass" or "fail". The more detail, the better the result.]`

**Example:**
> The primary matcher `toBeValidUser(id: number)` receives a user ID. It will asynchronously check if a user with this ID exists in a simulated database. It should pass if the user is found and fail otherwise. It must pass the found user object `{ id: number, name: string, role: 'admin' | 'guest' }` in its state for the secondary matcher.
>
> The secondary matcher `withRole(role: 'admin' | 'guest')` must be chained after `toBeValidUser`. It receives the user object from the state and passes only if the user's `role` property matches the provided `role` argument.
