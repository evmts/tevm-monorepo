Added viem client for interacting with evmts vm

Enhanced the `@tevm/memory-client` package by introducing the `viem` client extension. This new feature allows for more sophisticated interactions with the `tevm` virtual machine, including the ability to handle `NonVerboseTevmJsonRpcRequest` types and utilize the `superjson` library for serialization. The update includes new methods for tevm requests, script execution, and account management, as well as additional test coverage to ensure functionality. This extension is a step towards more flexible and powerful vm operations, paving the way for future enhancements.
