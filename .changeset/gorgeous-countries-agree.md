"@tevm/memory-client": patch
---

Updated tevm to not proxy any json rpc requests it doesn't support. Proxying creates confusion because some methods operate off of the tevm state and others may be using the RPC state creating confusing mismatches. This means for now all unsupported rpc methods to a MemoryTevm will throw.
