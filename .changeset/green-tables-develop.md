Added example app of usage of vite plugin in MUD framework

MUD is a framework for ambitious Ethereum applications. It compresses the complexity of building EVM apps with a tightly integrated software stack.

MUD and EVMts have similar goals. EVMts is approaching it from an unopionionated modular point of view whereas MUD is more of a batteries included opionated framework more similar to Ruby on Rails or NEXT.js. They don't compete with each other in their full form they very much complement each other.

MUD's template only has a single contract import but this can be improved upon in future as that one contract is an entrypoint to system contracts. Also EVMts provides a more streamlined way to interact with third party contracts not built with MUD storage
