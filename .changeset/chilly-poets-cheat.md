Implemented new typesafe error system based on viem errors and the JSON-RPC spec for error codes. All errors come with a typesafe `name` property along with link to docs about the error. They also have a `code` property that maps to ethereum JSON-RPC error codes. All concrete errors are implemented in the `@tevm/errors` package. Each function will then export a union error type of all the errors it and it's sub-functions can throw.
