# Function: deepCopy()

> **deepCopy**(`baseState`): () => `Promise`\<[`BaseState`](../type-aliases/BaseState.md)\>

Defined in: [packages/state/src/actions/deepCopy.js:17](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/blob/main/packages/state/src/actions/deepCopy.js#L17)

Returns a new instance of the ForkStateManager with the same opts and all storage copied over.

IMPORTANT: The fork cache is NOT copied but instead is shared between the original state
and the copied state. This is intentional and safe because:
1. Fork cache is read-only relative to the forked blockchain state at a specific block
2. Sharing the cache improves performance by preventing duplicate remote fetches
3. It enables persistent caching of fork data across VM instances

## Parameters

### baseState

[`BaseState`](../type-aliases/BaseState.md)

## Returns

> (): `Promise`\<[`BaseState`](../type-aliases/BaseState.md)\>

### Returns

`Promise`\<[`BaseState`](../type-aliases/BaseState.md)\>
