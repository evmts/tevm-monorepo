# Test Coverage Improvements

## What was fixed:
1. **accumulateParentBlockHash.spec.ts**
   - Updated from vitest to bun:test format
   - Fixed mocking approach using bun's mock system
   - Added proper assertions for bun

2. **genTxTrie.spec.ts**
   - Added tests for edge cases (null transactions, error handling)
   - Updated mocking format to be compatible with bun:test
   - Improved test coverage

3. **runTx.spec.ts**
   - Added event cleanup to prevent MaxListenersExceededWarning
   - Increased EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners to 100
   - Used afterEach hook to clean up event listeners

## Remaining issues:
1. **runBlock.spec.ts**
   - Mock for applyBlock still needs improvement
   - Need to mock blockchain.validateHeader properly
   - Error handling tests are not working properly

2. **accumulateParentBlockHash.ts**
   - Test coverage still needs improvement (currently at 0%)
   - Need to successfully mock the blockchain methods

## Next steps:
1. Fix the remaining runBlock.spec.ts issues by:
   - Implementing a more complete mock for the applyBlock function
   - Add validateHeader method to the blockchain mock
   - Ensure error propagation works correctly in tests

2. Implement tests for accumulateParentBlockHash.ts coverage:
   - Create proper mocks for all required methods
   - Ensure tests run in isolation without real blockchain dependencies

3. Consider implementing tests for:
   - applyDAOHardfork.ts (currently at 0% coverage)
   - genTxTrie.ts (still has low coverage)
