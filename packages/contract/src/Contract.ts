/**
 * An action creator for `Tevm.contract`, `Tevm.eth.getEvents` and more
 * It also is the type solidity contract imports are turned into.
 *
 * Contracts generate actions that can be dispatched to tevm methods
 * such as `contract` `traceContract` and `eth.events`
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * tevm.contract(
 * -  { abi: [...], args: ['0x1234...'], functionName: 'balanceOf' },
 * +  MyContract.atAddress('0x420...').read.balanceOf('0x1234...'),
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * A contract can be made via the `createContract` function
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { type Contract, createContract} from 'tevm/contract'
 *
 * const contract: Contract = createContract({
 *   name: 'MyContract',
 *  	abi: [
 *  		...
 *  	],
 * })
 * ```
 * These contracts can be automatically generated by using [@tevm/bundler](https://todo.todo)
 * and then importing it. The Tevm bundler will automatically resolve your solidity imports into
 * tevm contract instances
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { MyContract } from './MyContract.sol'
 *
 * console.log(MyContract.humanReadableAbi)
 * ```
 * Address can be added to a contract using the `withAddress` method
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { MyContract } from './MyContract.sol'
 *
 * const MyContractOptimism = MyContract.withAddress('0x420...')
 * ```
 * Contracts can also be used with other libraries such as Viem and ethers.
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { MyContract } from './MyContract.sol'
 * import { createPublicClient } from 'viem'
 *
 * // see viem docs
 * const client = createPublicClient({...})
 *
 * const result = await client.readContract(
 *   MyContract.withAddress('0x420...').read.balanceOf('0x1234...'),
 * )
