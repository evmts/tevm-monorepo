/**
 * A specialized Ethereum address class that extends EthjsAddress with TEVM-specific
 * functionality. This class provides EIP-55 compliant checksummed address formatting
 * and consistent behavior across the TEVM ecosystem.
 *
 * The Address class is the core representation of Ethereum addresses in TEVM's
 * low-level APIs. It handles the complexities of Ethereum addresses including:
 * - Proper hex encoding/decoding
 * - EIP-55 checksumming for error detection
 * - Consistent 20-byte binary representation
 *
 * This class should typically be created using the `createAddress` factory function
 * rather than being instantiated directly.
 *
 * @extends {EthjsAddress}
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * import { createAddress } from '@tevm/address';
 *
 * // From checksummed hex string
 * let address = createAddress('0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Ac136ddd64DBA72');
 *
 * // From lowercase hex string
 * address = createAddress('0x8ba1f109551bd432803012645ac136ddd64dba72');
 *
 * // From zero address
 * address = createAddress(`0x${'00'.repeat(20)}`);
 *
 * // From number or bigint
 * address = createAddress(0);
 * address = createAddress(123456789n);
 *
 * // From Uint8Array
 * address = createAddress(new Uint8Array(20));
 *
 * // From unprefixed hex string
 * address = createAddress('8ba1f109551bd432803012645ac136ddd64dba72');
 * ```
