- **Lines**: 99.94%

## Coverage Improvements

We've added several test files to improve code coverage:

1. `src/fork/fork.spec.ts` - Tests for ForkError and NoForkTransportSetError
2. `src/utils/utils.spec.ts` - Tests for DecodeFunctionDataError and EncodeFunctionReturnDataError
3. `src/defensive/defensive.spec.ts` - Tests for DefensiveNullCheckError and UnreachableCodeError
4. `src/input/input.spec.ts` - Tests for various input validation errors
5. `src/ethereum/BaseError.additional.spec.ts` - Additional tests for edge cases in BaseError

## Remaining Uncovered Branches

The remaining uncovered branches are mostly in edge case error handling in BaseError.js and some optional parameter branches in various error classes. Most of these are related to specific error conditions that are difficult to test, but the core functionality is well covered.

## Next Steps

To further improve coverage:

1. Add tests for the remaining error classes in the ethereumjs directory if they become important to the codebase
2. Consider adding tests for error situations that might be hard to trigger through normal code paths
