This document summarizes existing tests and identifies areas for additional testing for the TEVM Memory Client package.

## Newly Added Tests

The following tests have been implemented to demonstrate core features as described in the Tevm documentation:

- **Demonstrates:**
  - Creating snapshots at different points during execution
  - Restoring state to previous snapshots
  - Verifying contract state changes are properly tracked and restored

### 3. Forking Integration (`tevmForkIntegration.spec.ts`)
- **Implemented:** Network forking and state override functionality
- **Demonstrates:**
  - Creating forks from existing networks
  - Modifying local state while preserving fork state
  - Processing transactions on forked networks
  - Chain configuration handling with forks

### 4. Contract Interaction (`tevmContractIntegration.spec.ts`)

- **Demonstrates:**
  - Deploying contracts with constructor arguments
  - Reading contract state with tevmContract
  - Modifying contract state with transactions
  - Value transfers to contracts
  - Gas limit specification
  - Sequential state changes

### 5. Mining Modes (`tevmMiningModes.spec.ts`)
- **Implemented:** Tests for different mining configurations
- **Demonstrates:**
  - Automatic mining behavior
  - Manual mining control
  - Transaction batching with manual mining
  - Mining interval configuration

### 6. Account Management (`tevmAccountManagement.spec.ts`)
- **Implemented:** Tests for account state operations
- **Demonstrates:**
  - Setting and retrieving account balances and nonces
  - Setting contract bytecode
  - Setting and retrieving contract storage
  - Managing multiple accounts
  - Handling large storage structures

## Key Functionality Demonstrated

These new tests showcase several important concepts from the documentation:

1. **State Management**
   - Create complete snapshots of the EVM state
   - Restore from snapshots to reset state to previous points
   - Create multiple snapshots during execution
   - Selectively restore to different points in history

2. **Network Forking**
   - Fork from existing networks
   - Override fork state with local modifications
   - Execute transactions on forked state
   - Chain configuration with forks

3. **Contract Interaction**
   - Deploy contracts with constructor arguments
   - Call contract functions and verify results
   - Modify contract state and observe changes
   - Send value with contract interactions
   - Specify gas limits for transactions

4. **Account Management**
   - Create and modify account balances and nonces
   - Set contract bytecode
   - Manage contract storage
   - Handle multiple accounts simultaneously
   - Work with large storage structures

5. **Mining Control**
   - Use automatic mining for convenience
   - Use manual mining for precise control
   - Batch multiple transactions in single blocks
   - Configure mining intervals
