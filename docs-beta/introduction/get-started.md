# Get Started

Welcome to the EVMts docs!

## Overview

EVMts beta makes solidity a first-class citizen in TypeScript via it's build tools

- **Import Solidity directly** ABIs melt away with the ability to import contracts directly
- **Jump** directly from typescript files to contract implementation with go-to-definition
- Default **contract addresses** based on forge build artifacts

Future versions of EVMts plan to include a local VM and optimistic execution

- **PLANNED: Execute solidity scripts** as a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) in your TypeScript applications
- **PLANNED: Optimistic execution** of the EVM within the browser with [rEVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm)

## EVMts is simple

### 1. First write a smart contract


```solidity [MyERC20.sol]
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts"

contract ExampleContract is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("ERC20 Example", "Example 1") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 100_000_000_000 * 10**18 );
    }
}

```

### 2. Deploy your contract

Deploy your contract with [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) and commit the deploy artifacts.

### 3. Import your contract directly in TypeScript files and use it

- no code gen step
- no abis
- no boilerplate

Just import your script and use it in your React components with [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh)

```ts [example.ts]
import { MyERC20 } from './MyERC20.sol'
import { useContractRead } from '@evmts/react'
import { useAccount } from 'wagmi'

export function App() {
	const { address } = useAccount()
	const { data: tokenBalance } = useContractRead(
		MyERC20.balanceOf(address),
	)
	return (
		<div>Balance: {tokenBalance.toString()}</div>
	)
}

```
