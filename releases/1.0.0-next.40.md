# 1.0.0-next.40

## 🔥 Breaking changes

Breaking error behavior to `@tevm/actions` and all clients

- All tevm actions `call`, `contract`, `script`, `dumpState`, `loadState`, `getAccount`, and `setAccount` now throw by default.
- Old behavior is still available via the new `throwOnFail` option which defaults to `true`


## 🐛 Bugs

- Fixed bug with bundler working with `@tevm/contract` installed but not when `tevm` is installed
- Fixed bug with bun runtime failing to resolve contract resolutions

## ✨ Features

New client options

- [Added new `persistence` option to memory client](https://tevm.sh/learn/clients/) to persist state in syncronous storage such as local storage
- added new `@tevm/sync-storage-persister` package.

```typescript
import {createMemoryClient, createSyncPersister} from 'tevm'

// Client state will be hydrated and persisted from/to local storage
const clientWithLocalStoragePersistence = createMemoryClient({
  persister: createSyncPersister({
    storage: localStorage
  })
})
```

Bundler features

- Made `tevm.json` file optional
