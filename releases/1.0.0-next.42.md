# ✨✨✨New release! 1.0.0-next.42 ✨✨✨

This is a big release after not releasing for a while

## 🔥 Breaking changes

- State changes will not be included in the cannonical chain until tevmClient.mine() is called for tevm_call. This is not the case for cheat methods like tevm_setAccount though which will immediately update the cannonical chain (e.g. 'latest')

## ✨ Features

Blocks exist! Previously tevm just modified state but didn't mine blocks
- tevm client takes a miningConfig. Currently only manual is accepted but more mining modes will be added in a future release
- tevm_call, tevm_contract, and tevm_script now return a txHash if `setTransaction` is set to true. The tx can then be mined via calling `tevmClient.mine()`
- eth_getReceipt implemented as well
- blockTag property works for both historical blocks in a fork and blocks tevm mines

More features
- State overrides added to eth_call and tevm_call https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/976
- tevm_getAccount can now optionally return contract storage for the account https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/976
- lots of json_rpc endpoints added but will not be stable til a later release
- new traceConfig property in tevm_call, tevm_script, and tevm_contract will return an EVM trace https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/1036
- new logConfig option to tevm clients to set the log level. Set to debugging for detailed logs. Logging will be added to over next few releases

## 🪲 Bugs

- Fixed bug with not returning the correct createdAddresses in tevm_call https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/1020
- Fixed a lot more minor bugs

## 🔨Internal changes

- Upgraded to latest ethereumjs (blob support)
- All internal modules except the EVM now have custom Tevm implementations rather than wrapping ethereumjs
- new ReceiptsManager package
- StateManager able to`checkout` different state roots based on previously mined blocks
