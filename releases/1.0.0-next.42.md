# âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨New release! 1.0.0-next.42 âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

This is a big release after not releasing for a while

## ðŸ”¥ Breaking changes

- State changes will not be included in the cannonical chain until tevmClient.mine() is called for tevm_call. This is not the case for cheat methods like tevm_setAccount though which will immediately update the cannonical chain (e.g. 'latest')

## âœ¨ Features

Blocks exist! Previously tevm just modified state but didn't mine blocks
- tevm client takes a miningConfig. Currently only manual is accepted but more mining modes will be added in a future release
- tevm_call, tevm_contract, and tevm_script now return a txHash if `setTransaction` is set to true. The tx can then be mined via calling `tevmClient.mine()`
- eth_getReceipt implemented as well
- blockTag property works for both historical blocks in a fork and blocks tevm mines

More features
- State and block overrides added to eth_call and tevm_call https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/976
- tevm_getAccount can now optionally return contract storage for the account https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/976
- lots of json_rpc endpoints added but will not be stable til a later release
- new traceConfig property in tevm_call, tevm_script, and tevm_contract will return an EVM trace https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/1036
- new logConfig option to tevm clients to set the log level. Set to debugging for detailed logs. Logging will be added to over next few releases

## ðŸª² Bugs

- Fixed bug with not returning the correct createdAddresses in tevm_call https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/pull/1020
- Fixed a lot more minor bugs

## ðŸ”¨Internal changes

- Upgraded to latest ethereumjs (blob support)
- All internal modules except the EVM now have custom Tevm implementations rather than wrapping ethereumjs
- new `@tevm/receipts-manager` package. The receiptsManager is what handles efficiently storing and retrieving receipt data
- New `@tevm/tx-pool` package. This package represents the mempool and is where tx are sent before they are mined
- StateManager able to`checkout` different state roots based on previously mined blocks
- Tests now use alchemy rather than public endpoint. That means contributors will need to set an alchemy key or potentially face throttling. If not set the public alchemy key is used.
