# EIP-3198 (BASEFEE Opcode) Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Added EIP-3198 Flag in Chain Rules**
   - Added `IsEIP3198` flag to the `ChainRules` struct in `Evm.zig`
   - Set the flag to `true` by default since we're targeting the latest Ethereum version

2. **Updated BASEFEE Opcode Implementation**
   - Modified the `opBasefee` function in `block.zig` to check for `IsEIP3198` flag instead of `IsEIP1559`
   - Updated comments to clarify that this is for EIP-3198
   - The opcode implementation already had the correct gas cost (GasQuickStep = 2) and stack behavior

3. **Created Test Cases**
   - Added a new test file `eip3198.test.zig` to verify the implementation
   - Included tests for both enabled and disabled scenarios
   - The test creates a contract that uses the BASEFEE opcode and verifies execution behavior

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Created `eip3198_implementation.md` to document the implementation details
   - Updated `TODO_EIP.md` to mark EIP-3198 as implemented
   - Updated the implementation order list to mark EIP-3198 as complete

## Next Steps

With EIP-3198 now implemented, the next items in the implementation order are:

1. Implement Shanghai opcodes (PUSH0)
2. Implement Cancun opcodes (TLOAD, TSTORE, MCOPY, etc.)
3. Implement EIP-4844 (Shard Blob Transactions)

## Testing Notes

The test cases verify that:
- The BASEFEE opcode works correctly when EIP-3198 is enabled
- The BASEFEE opcode fails with InvalidOpcode error when EIP-3198 is disabled

While our implementation uses a fixed value (1 gwei) for the base fee, a full implementation would retrieve the actual base fee from the block header, which would be determined by the EIP-1559 fee market mechanism.

## Chain Rule Integration

In the final implementation, the EIP-3198 flag is set based on the hardfork:
- For London and later hardforks: `IsEIP3198` is `true`
- For pre-London hardforks: `IsEIP3198` is `false`

This aligns with Ethereum's actual deployment of this feature in the London hardfork.
