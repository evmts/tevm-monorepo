# EIP-3855 (PUSH0 Opcode) Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Updated PUSH0 Opcode Implementation**
   - Modified the `opPush0` function in `memory.zig` to check for the `IsEIP3855` flag
   - Added code to return `ExecutionError.InvalidOpcode` if EIP-3855 is not enabled
   - Updated comments to clarify that this is for EIP-3855

2. **Updated Jump Table Registration**
   - Added a comment to the PUSH0 opcode registration to indicate it's for EIP-3855
   - The gas cost (GasQuickStep = 2) remains the same, consistent with other PUSH opcodes

3. **Created Test Cases**
   - Added a new test file `eip3855.test.zig` to verify the implementation
   - Included tests for both enabled and disabled scenarios
   - The test creates a contract that uses the PUSH0 opcode and verifies execution behavior

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Created `eip3855_implementation.md` to document the implementation details
   - Updated `TODO_EIP.md` to mark the Shanghai PUSH0 opcode as implemented
   - Updated the implementation order list to mark PUSH0 as complete

## Next Steps

With PUSH0 now implemented, the next items in the implementation order are:

1. Implement Cancun opcodes (TLOAD, TSTORE, MCOPY, etc.)
2. Implement EIP-4844 (Shard Blob Transactions)

## Testing Notes

The test cases verify that:
- The PUSH0 opcode works correctly when EIP-3855 is enabled
- The PUSH0 opcode fails with InvalidOpcode error when EIP-3855 is disabled

## Gas Advantages

The PUSH0 opcode provides gas efficiency by:
- Using 2 gas (GasQuickStep) instead of the 3 gas that would be used by PUSH1 0x00
- Reducing bytecode size by 1 byte per usage, which also reduces deployment costs

## Chain Rule Integration

In the final implementation, the EIP-3855 flag is set based on the hardfork:
- For Shanghai and later hardforks: `IsEIP3855` is `true`
- For pre-Shanghai hardforks: `IsEIP3855` is `false`

This aligns with Ethereum's actual deployment of this opcode in the Shanghai hardfork.
