# EIP-5656 (MCOPY Opcode) Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Added EIP-5656 Flag in Chain Rules**
   - Added `IsEIP5656` flag to the `ChainRules` struct in `Evm.zig`
   - Set the flag to `true` by default for Cancun and later hardforks
   - Updated all hardfork configurations to disable EIP-5656 in pre-Cancun hardforks

2. **Updated MCOPY Opcode Implementation**
   - Modified the `opMcopy` function in `blob.zig` to check for the `IsEIP5656` flag
   - Added code to return `ExecutionError.InvalidOpcode` if EIP-5656 is not enabled
   - Improved documentation and comments

3. **Created Test Cases**
   - Added a new test file `eip5656.test.zig` to verify the implementation
   - Included tests for both enabled and disabled scenarios
   - Created a comprehensive test contract that initializes memory, uses MCOPY, and returns copied data for verification

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Created `eip5656_implementation.md` to document the implementation details
   - Updated `TODO_EIP.md` to mark the Cancun MCOPY opcode as implemented
   - Updated the implementation order list to include MCOPY as a completed item

## Next Steps

With MCOPY now implemented, the next items in the implementation order are:

1. Implement remaining Cancun opcodes (TLOAD, TSTORE)
2. Complete the EIP-4844 implementation

## Implementation Details

The MCOPY opcode implementation includes:

1. **Stack Processing**
   - Pops three values from the stack: destination offset, source offset, and length
   - Does not push any values back to the stack

2. **Memory Operations**
   - Performs bounds checking to ensure memory access is valid
   - Uses a temporary buffer to safely handle potentially overlapping memory regions
   - Completes the copy operation without altering any other memory

3. **Gas Calculation**
   - Uses a complex gas formula that accounts for:
     - Base cost (3 gas)
     - Memory expansion cost using the standard quadratic formula
     - Per-word cost based on the length of data copied

4. **Error Handling**
   - Validates EIP-5656 is enabled
   - Checks for stack underflow
   - Performs memory bounds validation
   - Handles memory allocation errors

## Testing Notes

The test cases verify that:
- The MCOPY opcode works correctly when EIP-5656 is enabled
- The opcode fails when EIP-5656 is disabled
- Memory is correctly copied from the source location to the destination

The primary test initializes memory with distinct patterns, performs the MCOPY operation, and verifies that the data was copied correctly by returning it and comparing against expected values.

## Importance in Ethereum

The MCOPY opcode is a significant efficiency improvement for Ethereum smart contracts, particularly those that manipulate large memory regions. By providing a native, gas-efficient way to copy memory, it enables more complex memory operations without excessive gas costs or code complexity.
