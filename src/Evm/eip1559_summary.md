# EIP-1559 (Fee Market Change) Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Added Block Header Fields**
   - Added `base_fee_per_gas` field to the block header structure
   - Added gas target (target gas usage per block) functionality
   - Added gas limit adjustment logic based on EIP-1559 rules

2. **Implemented Fee Calculation Mechanism**
   - Added base fee calculation logic between blocks (adjusts based on gas usage)
   - Implemented fee burning mechanism for the base fee portion of transaction fees
   - Added priority fee handling for direct miner/validator compensation

3. **Added Transaction Type Support**
   - Implemented support for Type-2 (EIP-1559) transactions with:
     - `max_fee_per_gas` parameter (maximum total fee the sender is willing to pay)
     - `max_priority_fee_per_gas` parameter (maximum tip for validator/miner)
   - Handled backwards compatibility with legacy transaction types

4. **Updated Gas Accounting**
   - Implemented dynamic base fee calculation based on block fullness
   - Added fee burning logic (the base fee portion is now burned/removed from circulation)
   - Ensured that only the priority fee goes to the block producer

5. **Created Tests**
   - Added test cases for base fee calculation algorithm
   - Added test cases for Type-2 transaction processing
   - Verified fee burning and priority fee distribution
   - Tested compatibility with legacy transactions

6. **Updated Documentation**
   - Created `eip1559_implementation.md` with detailed implementation notes
   - Updated `TODO_EIP.md` to mark EIP-1559 as implemented
   - Added inline documentation for the implementation details

## How EIP-1559 Works

EIP-1559 introduces a new fee market mechanism to Ethereum with these key components:

1. **Base Fee**:
   - Each block has a base fee that all transactions must pay
   - This fee is burned (removed from circulation), not given to miners
   - The base fee automatically adjusts based on network congestion
   - If the previous block used more gas than the target, the base fee increases
   - If the previous block used less gas than the target, the base fee decreases
   - Maximum change per block is 12.5% (1/8)

2. **Priority Fee**:
   - Users specify a "tip" to miners called the priority fee
   - This is the only part of the fee that goes to miners/validators
   - Higher priority fees incentivize miners to include a transaction sooner

3. **Max Fee**:
   - Users specify the maximum total fee they're willing to pay
   - Actual fee paid = min(max_fee_per_gas, base_fee_per_gas + priority_fee_per_gas)
   - Any difference between max fee and actual fee is refunded to the user

4. **Variable Block Size**:
   - Target block gas limit remains the same (e.g., 15M gas)
   - But blocks can now be up to 2x the target size (30M gas) temporarily
   - This helps absorb sudden traffic spikes

## Next Steps

With EIP-1559 now implemented, the next items in the implementation order are:

1. Implement EIP-4895: Beacon chain withdrawals
2. Implement EIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode

## Testing Notes

The test cases verify that:
- The base fee adjusts correctly based on block fullness
- Type-2 transactions (EIP-1559) are processed correctly
- Fee burning works as expected with only priority fees going to miners
- Legacy transactions continue to work as expected

## Chain Rule Integration

The EIP-1559 flag is set based on the hardfork:
- For London and later hardforks: `IsEIP1559` is `true`
- For pre-London hardforks: `IsEIP1559` is `false`
