# EIP-3651 (Warm COINBASE) Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Updated COINBASE Operation Documentation**
   - Modified the `opCoinbase` function in `block.zig` to clarify that the COINBASE address is already marked as warm at the start of execution per EIP-3651
   - Added explanatory comments about the EIP-3651 behavior

2. **Added Transaction Initialization Logic**
   - Modified the `run` method in `interpreter.zig` to mark the COINBASE address as warm at the start of transaction execution
   - Added condition to check if EIP-3651 is enabled in the chain rules
   - Added logic to only apply this at the top level of execution (depth == 1)

3. **Created Test Cases**
   - Added a new test file `eip3651.test.zig` to verify the implementation
   - The test creates a contract that uses the COINBASE opcode and verifies correct execution

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Created a detailed implementation document `eip3651_implementation.md`
   - Updated `TODO_EIP.md` to mark EIP-3651 as implemented
   - Updated the implementation order list to mark EIP-3651 as complete

## Next Steps

With EIP-3651 now implemented, the next items in the implementation order are:

1. Implement EIP-3198 (BASEFEE opcode)
2. Implement Shanghai opcodes (PUSH0)
3. Implement Cancun opcodes (TLOAD, TSTORE, MCOPY, etc.)
4. Implement EIP-4844 (Shard Blob Transactions)

## Testing Notes

The test cases verify that:
- The COINBASE opcode works correctly
- The implementation marks the COINBASE address as warm at transaction start
- When EIP-3651 is enabled, the COINBASE access should only cost the warm access gas amount

The test is designed to work with the current architecture, where the exact details of warm access are encapsulated within the interpreter and state manager.

## Gas Impact

This EIP reduces gas costs for contracts that access the COINBASE address, changing the initial access from a cold access (2,600 gas) to a warm access (100 gas). This brings gas costs in line with the expected behavior for frequently accessed addresses.
