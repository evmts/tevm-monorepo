# EVM Implementation Updates

## Latest Features

### Warm/Cold Access Tracking (EIP-2929)

Implemented tracking of warm/cold storage slots and accounts for gas metering:

- Contract now tracks accessed storage slots to determine if they're cold (first access) or warm
- Contract also tracks account access status
- Storage operations (SLOAD, SSTORE) now mark slots as warm after first access
- Gas calculations are prepared to use warm/cold status for EIP-2929 compliance

This forms the foundation for full EIP-2929 gas cost calculations.

## Future Features

See TODO_EIP.md for planned features and implementations.
