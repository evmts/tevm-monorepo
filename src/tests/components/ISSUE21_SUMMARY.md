# Implementation of Return Data Buffer Management (Issue #21)

## Summary

This implementation resolves Issue #21 from ISSUES.md, which required proper implementation of the return data buffer with support for RETURNDATASIZE and RETURNDATACOPY opcodes.

The key components implemented include:

1. Enhanced the dispatch system to properly integrate with the return data buffer in the interpreter
2. Implemented proper gas accounting for return data operations
3. Set up appropriate error handling for out-of-bounds access
4. Created comprehensive test cases for all return data operations

## Changes

1. Updated the `executeInstruction` function in `dispatch.zig` to accept a `return_data` parameter
2. Implemented proper handling of RETURNDATASIZE and RETURNDATACOPY opcodes with integrated return data buffer
3. Updated the interpreter to pass the return data buffer to the dispatch system
4. Created extensive test coverage for return data operations and error handling

## Technical Details

- The return data buffer (`ReturnData` in `return_data.zig`) is maintained by the interpreter
- When bytecode calls RETURNDATASIZE or RETURNDATACOPY, the dispatch system now properly accesses this buffer
- Gas accounting has been implemented for both opcodes:
  - RETURNDATASIZE: 2 gas (base cost)
  - RETURNDATACOPY: 3 gas (base cost) + memory expansion cost based on size
- Error handling has been added for:
  - Out-of-bounds access to return data
  - Invalid parameters (e.g. offsets or sizes that don't fit in usize)
  - Out-of-gas conditions

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been implemented to verify the functionality:

1. `return_data_test.zig` - Tests for the ReturnData structure itself
2. `returndatasize_returndatacopy_test.zig` - Tests for the opcode implementations
3. `return_data_opcode_dispatch_test.zig` - Tests for opcode registration and dispatch
4. `dispatch_return_data_integration_test.zig` - Tests for the integration between dispatch and return data
5. `return_data_buffer_management_test.zig` - Tests for the specific requirements of Issue #21

These tests verify all aspects of return data handling, including:
- Basic operations on the return data buffer
- Opcode functionality for RETURNDATASIZE and RETURNDATACOPY
- Error handling for out-of-bounds access
- Integration with the interpreter execution flow
- Proper propagation of return data between calls
- Memory management and cleanup

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation fully resolves Issue #21, future improvements could include:

1. Further optimization of memory usage in the return data buffer
2. More sophisticated gas accounting for memory expansion based on EVM specifications
3. Enhanced tracing support for return data operations
4. Support for additional EIPs that affect return data behavior
