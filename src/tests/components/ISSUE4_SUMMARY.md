# ISSUE #4: Arithmetic Instructions - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds support for the signed arithmetic operations SDIV and SMOD in the ZigEVM. These opcodes handle signed integers using two's complement representation, a standard method for representing signed numbers in binary form.

## Implemented Functionality

1. **SDIV (Signed Division) - Opcode 0x05**
   - Takes two U256 values from the stack
   - Interprets them as signed numbers in two's complement format
   - Performs signed division and pushes the result onto the stack
   - Maintains correct sign in the result (negative if only one of the operands is negative)
   - Handles division by zero by returning zero

2. **SMOD (Signed Modulo) - Opcode 0x07**
   - Takes two U256 values from the stack
   - Interprets them as signed numbers in two's complement format
   - Performs signed modulo operation and pushes the result onto the stack
   - Result takes the sign of the dividend (per EVM specification)
   - Handles modulo by zero by returning zero

## Implementation Details

### Helper Functions

- **isNegative(value: U256)**: Checks if the most significant bit (bit 255) is set, indicating a negative number in two's complement representation
- **twoComplement(value: U256)**: Computes the two's complement of a U256 value (~x + 1)
- **unsignedDiv(a: U256, b: U256)**: Performs unsigned division for use in the signed division logic
- **unsignedMod(a: U256, b: U256)**: Performs unsigned modulo for use in the signed modulo logic

### Gas Costs

- SDIV: 5 gas units (same as DIV)
- SMOD: 5 gas units (same as MOD)

### Updated Components

1. **src/opcodes/arithmetic.zig**
   - Added implementations for SDIV and SMOD
   - Added helper functions for signed arithmetic operations
   - Added tests for new functions

2. **src/opcodes/dispatch.zig**
   - Updated dispatch table to include SDIV and SMOD
   - Note: Both SDIV and SMOD were already defined in the opcodes enum

3. **src/tests/components/signed_arithmetic_test.zig**
   - Added comprehensive tests for SDIV and SMOD
   - Tests include bytecode execution with positive and negative numbers
   - Tests include combined execution of both operations

## Verification

Tests were created to verify that:
- SDIV correctly handles division with both positive and negative values
- SMOD correctly implements the EVM-specified behavior for signed modulo
- Both operations correctly handle edge cases (division/modulo by zero)
- Results match expected values from the EVM specification

## EVM Specification Compliance

The implementation follows the Ethereum Yellow Paper specifications for signed arithmetic operations:
- Negative numbers are represented in two's complement
- Division rounds towards zero
- For SMOD, the sign of the result matches the sign of the dividend
- Division or modulo by zero results in zero
