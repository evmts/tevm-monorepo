# ISSUE #5: Bitwise Instructions - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds the remaining bitwise and comparison operations to the ZigEVM, specifically focusing on the signed comparison opcodes (SLT and SGT) that were missing from the dispatcher. Additionally, it adds proper integration of all bitwise operations into the opcode dispatch system and creates comprehensive tests for these operations.

## Implemented Functionality

1. **Signed Less Than (SLT) - Opcode 0x12**
   - Takes two U256 values from the stack
   - Interprets them as signed numbers with the most significant bit determining sign
   - Compares them and pushes 1 (true) or 0 (false) onto the stack
   - Handles special cases for different sign combinations

2. **Signed Greater Than (SGT) - Opcode 0x13**
   - Takes two U256 values from the stack
   - Interprets them as signed numbers with the most significant bit determining sign
   - Compares them and pushes 1 (true) or 0 (false) onto the stack
   - Handles special cases for different sign combinations

3. **Updated Dispatch Table**
   - Added all 14 bitwise and comparison opcodes to the dispatcher:
     - LT, GT, SLT, SGT (comparison operations)
     - EQ, ISZERO (equality operations)
     - AND, OR, XOR, NOT (bitwise operations)
     - BYTE (byte access operation)
     - SHL, SHR, SAR (shift operations)

## Implementation Details

### Signed Comparison Logic

For SLT and SGT operations, the implementation follows these rules:
- If one number is negative and the other is positive, the negative number is always less than the positive number
- If both numbers are positive, standard unsigned comparison is used
- If both numbers are negative, the comparison is inverted (larger magnitude means smaller number)

For example:
- SLT: `-10 < 5` returns `true` because negative is less than positive
- SLT: `-5 < -10` returns `false` because -5 has smaller magnitude than -10
- SGT: `10 > -5` returns `true` because positive is greater than negative
- SGT: `-5 > -10` returns `true` because -5 has smaller magnitude than -10

### Gas Costs

All bitwise and comparison operations use a gas cost of 3 units, as defined in the Ethereum Yellow Paper for simple operations.

### Updated Components

1. **src/opcodes/bitwise.zig**
   - Implemented SLT and SGT operations
   - Added comprehensive tests for both operations
   - Existing implementations were already available for other bitwise operations

2. **src/opcodes/dispatch.zig**
   - Updated the opcode dispatcher to include all bitwise and comparison operations
   - Mapped all opcodes to their correct handlers

3. **src/tests/components/bitwise_test.zig**
   - Created comprehensive tests for all bitwise operations
   - Tests include bytecode execution for:
     - Signed comparisons (SLT, SGT)
     - Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
     - Shift operations (SHL, SHR, SAR)
     - Special cases like negative numbers with shifts

## Verification

Tests were created to verify that:
- SLT and SGT correctly implement signed comparison semantics
- All bitwise operations produce correct results
- Operations handle edge cases properly (negative numbers, shifts by large amounts)
- Results match expected values from the EVM specification

## EVM Specification Compliance

The implementation follows the Ethereum Yellow Paper specifications for bitwise and signed comparison operations:
- Negative numbers are detected by checking the most significant bit (bit 255)
- SLT and SGT comparisons follow the specified semantics for signed values
- Shift operations handle shifts greater than 256 by producing appropriate results (0 for SHL/SHR, 0 or all 1s for SAR)
- SAR preserves the sign bit for negative numbers
