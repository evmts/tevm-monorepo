# Issue #7: Storage Instructions Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds support for storage operations in the ZigEVM. Storage is a critical component of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing contracts to persist state between transactions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Storage Data Structure
- Implemented a `Storage` structure that uses a hash map to store key-value pairs
- Added methods for loading and storing values, checking existence, and managing the storage state
- Included methods for handling storage clearing and maintaining capacity

### 2. Storage Instructions
- **SLOAD (0x54)**: Load a value from storage
  - Takes a key from the stack and pushes the corresponding value
  - Implemented gas cost calculation (simplified to base cold access cost)
  - Added error handling for unavailable storage

- **SSTORE (0x55)**: Store a value to storage
  - Takes a key and value from the stack and stores in the contract's storage
  - Implemented EIP-2200 net gas metering logic
  - Added proper gas refund tracking for storage clearing
  - Added static call context validation to prevent state modifications in static calls

### 3. Integration with Interpreter
- Added a `Storage` instance to the `Interpreter` structure
- Initialized and cleaned up storage properly in the interpreter lifecycle
- Added an `is_static` flag to the interpreter to track whether the current execution is a static call
- Updated the dispatch call to pass storage and the static flag to the instruction handler

### 4. Error Handling
- Added new error types:
  - `Error.StorageUnavailable`: When storage operations are attempted but storage is not available
  - `Error.StaticModeViolation`: When state-modifying operations are attempted in static context

### 5. Comprehensive Tests
- Added tests for basic storage operations (load, store, clear)
- Added tests for SLOAD and SSTORE opcodes
- Added tests for detecting static mode violations
- Added integration tests that execute complete EVM programs using storage operations

## EIP-2200: Net Gas Metering for SSTORE

This implementation follows EIP-2200, which introduced net gas metering for SSTORE operations. The key aspects implemented:

1. Different gas costs based on the current state:
   - Setting a slot from zero to non-zero: 20,000 gas
   - Changing a slot from non-zero to non-zero: 5,000 gas
   - Clearing a slot (setting to zero): 5,000 gas with 15,000 gas refund

2. Special cases for multiple operations on the same slot:
   - Changing a slot multiple times in one transaction
   - Clearing and resetting a slot
   - Restoring a slot to its original value

The implementation properly tracks gas refunds, which are critical for incentivizing "state clearing" operations in Ethereum.

## Technical Challenges

1. **Gas Cost Calculation**: Implementing the complex gas cost rules from EIP-2200 required careful tracking of original, current, and new values.

2. **Static Context Handling**: Ensured that storage modifications are rejected when executed in a static context.

3. **Integration with Dispatcher**: Updated the dispatch flow to correctly handle storage operations and propagate appropriate errors.

## Future Improvements

1. **Access Lists**: Implement EIP-2929/2930 access list support for reduced gas costs on warm storage slots.

2. **State Management**: Connect with a proper state manager for persisting storage between calls and transactions.

3. **Optimization**: Optimize storage access patterns to minimize memory allocations and hash calculations.

4. **Transient Storage**: Implement EIP-1153 for transient storage operations.

## Conclusion

The storage implementation now provides the fundamental capabilities needed for contract state persistence in ZigEVM. This allows for executing more complex smart contracts that rely on state changes between operations.
