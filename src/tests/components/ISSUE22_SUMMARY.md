# Issue #22: System Operation Instructions Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds support for system operation instructions in ZigEVM. System operations are critical EVM opcodes that interact with the blockchain state and environment, such as emitting logs (events) and self-destructing contracts. These operations form the foundation for smart contract interactions with the outside world.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Log Operations (LOG0-LOG4)
- **Implemented LOG0, LOG1, LOG2, LOG3, and LOG4 opcodes** for emitting events
- Added proper gas cost calculation:
  - Base cost: 375 gas
  - Additional cost per topic: 375 gas per topic
  - Additional cost for data: 8 gas per byte
  - Memory expansion costs
- Implemented static call context validation to prevent state changes in static calls
- Added foundation for event logging in the EVM execution environment

### 2. SELFDESTRUCT Operation
- **Implemented the SELFDESTRUCT opcode** for contract self-destruction
- Added gas cost calculation (5000 gas base cost)
- Implemented static call context validation
- Created foundation for account state management

### 3. Return Operations Support
- Added explicit handling for RETURN and REVERT opcodes in the dispatch system
- Created placeholders for other system operations (CREATE, CALL, etc.) for future implementation

### 4. Static Call Context Checking
- Added validation to ensure that state-modifying operations (LOG, SSTORE, SELFDESTRUCT) fail in static contexts
- Implemented proper error handling for static context violations

### 5. Error Handling
- Added appropriate gas checks for all system operations
- Implemented error propagation for invalid operations
- Added tests to verify error handling for various edge cases

### 6. Extensive Testing
- Created comprehensive integration tests for LOG and SELFDESTRUCT operations
- Added tests for static context violations
- Created tests for gas consumption verification
- Added out-of-gas scenario testing

## Technical Details

### LOG Operations (0xA0-0xA4)

LOG operations in Ethereum emit events that external services can subscribe to. The implementation supports:

1. **Different Topic Counts**: LOG0 (no topics), LOG1 (1 topic), LOG2 (2 topics), LOG3 (3 topics), and LOG4 (4 topics)
2. **Memory Operations**: Reading event data from specified memory regions
3. **Gas Calculations**:
   - Base cost is 375 gas
   - Each topic adds another 375 gas
   - Data costs 8 gas per byte
   - Memory expansion costs are also considered

### SELFDESTRUCT Operation (0xFF)

The SELFDESTRUCT operation allows a contract to delete itself and send its remaining Ether to a specified address. Key aspects of the implementation:

1. **Beneficiary Address**: Extracted from the stack as the recipient of the contract's balance
2. **Gas Cost**: Fixed cost of 5000 gas (simplified from the actual EVM specification)
3. **State Validation**: Prevents execution in static contexts

### Integration with Interpreter

The implementation fully integrates with the existing interpreter and dispatch system:

1. **Opcode Dispatch**: Updated the dispatch system to route LOG and SELFDESTRUCT opcodes to their handlers
2. **Gas Metering**: Properly accounts for gas consumption in both normal and error cases
3. **Error Propagation**: Ensures errors are correctly propagated back to the caller

## Gas Cost Model

The implementation follows the gas cost models from the Ethereum Yellow Paper and subsequent EIPs:

### LOG Operations
- Base cost: 375 gas
- Topic cost: 375 gas per topic
- Data cost: 8 gas per byte
- Plus memory expansion costs

### SELFDESTRUCT
- Base cost: 5000 gas (simplified model)

## Limitations and Future Work

The current implementation has several limitations that will be addressed in future work:

1. **Actual Event Emission**: Currently, LOG operations perform all the gas accounting and validation but don't actually emit events to an external system. Future work will add hooks for event subscription.

2. **Complete SELFDESTRUCT Semantics**: The current implementation handles gas and validation but doesn't perform the actual state changes (balance transfer and contract deletion). Future work will integrate with account state management.

3. **Call Operations**: CALL, CALLCODE, DELEGATECALL, and STATICCALL are currently stub implementations that return errors. These will be implemented in future work.

4. **CREATE Operations**: CREATE and CREATE2 operations are currently stub implementations. Full contract creation support will be added in future work.

5. **Block Information and Environment**: Full support for accessing block information (timestamps, etc.) will be implemented separately.

## Testing Strategy

The implementation includes extensive testing to ensure correctness:

1. **Unit Tests**: Basic functionality tests for individual operations
2. **Integration Tests**: Tests that verify the operations work correctly within the interpreter
3. **Error Case Tests**: Tests that verify proper handling of invalid operations
4. **Gas Calculation Tests**: Tests that verify gas is calculated and charged correctly

## Conclusion

This implementation provides the foundation for system operations in ZigEVM, focusing on LOG and SELFDESTRUCT operations. The code is structured to allow easy extension for the remaining system operations in future work. The integration with the existing interpreter and dispatch system ensures that these operations work seamlessly within the overall ZigEVM architecture.
