# ISSUE #6: Memory Instructions - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation completes the support for all memory operations in the ZigEVM, specifically focusing on properly integrating the existing memory opcode implementations into the dispatch system. It also adds comprehensive tests for bytecode execution of memory operations.

## Implemented Functionality

1. **Updated Opcode Dispatcher**
   - Added all five memory opcodes to the dispatcher:
     - MLOAD (0x51): Load a 32-byte word from memory
     - MSTORE (0x52): Store a 32-byte word to memory
     - MSTORE8 (0x53): Store a single byte to memory
     - MSIZE (0x59): Get the current size of memory
     - MCOPY (0x5E): Copy data within memory (Cancun EIP)

2. **Comprehensive Tests**
   - Created tests for all memory operations through actual bytecode execution
   - Implemented tests for memory expansion gas costs
   - Added tests for out-of-gas scenarios with excessive memory expansion

## Implementation Details

### Memory Operations

Each memory operation in the EVM:
- Manages memory expansion automatically when accessing beyond the current size
- Calculates appropriate gas costs for memory expansion
- Handles memory in 32-byte words as per the EVM specification

### Gas Calculation

Memory expansion follows the gas formula from the Ethereum Yellow Paper:
- 3 gas per memory word
- Additional gas for quadratic growth: `words * words / 512`
- Gas is only charged for expanding memory beyond its current size

For example:
- Expanding from 0 to 32 bytes (1 word) costs 3 gas
- Expanding from 0 to 64 bytes (2 words) costs 6 gas + 2²/512 gas
- Expanding from 0 to 4128 bytes (129 words) costs 387 gas + (129²)/512 = 387 + 32 = 419 gas

### Updated Components

1. **src/opcodes/dispatch.zig**
   - Added missing MSIZE and MCOPY opcodes to the dispatch table

2. **src/tests/components/memory_test.zig**
   - Created comprehensive tests for all memory operations through bytecode execution
   - Tests include:
     - Basic MLOAD/MSTORE operations
     - Single-byte operations with MSTORE8
     - Memory size reporting with MSIZE
     - Memory copy operations with MCOPY
     - Gas costs for memory expansion
     - Out-of-gas error handling

## Verification

Tests were created to verify that:
- All memory operations correctly manipulate memory contents
- Memory expansion properly allocates and zeroes new memory
- Gas costs for memory expansion follow the EVM specification
- Out-of-gas conditions are properly detected and reported

## EVM Specification Compliance

The implementation follows the Ethereum Yellow Paper specifications for memory operations:
- Memory is a single-dimension byte array that grows as needed
- Memory is always zeroed on expansion
- Memory is word-addressed for most operations (32-byte words)
- Gas costs follow the quadratic formula to discourage excessive memory usage
