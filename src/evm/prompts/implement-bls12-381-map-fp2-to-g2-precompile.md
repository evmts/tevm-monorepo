## Context

Implement the BLS12-381 MAP_FP2_TO_G2 precompile (address 0x11) as defined in EIP-2537. This precompile maps an extension field element (Fp2) to a point on the G2 curve using a deterministic hash-to-curve algorithm, essential for hash-to-curve operations on G2 in BLS signature schemes.

## ELI5

This is like the MAP_FP_TO_G1 operation, but working in a more complex mathematical space. Think of Fp2 elements as complex numbers (with real and imaginary parts), and G2 points as locations on a curved surface in this complex space. The MAP_FP2_TO_G2 precompile takes a complex number (Fp2 element) and converts it into a valid G2 point on the curve - like having a GPS that works in a complex coordinate system and can snap any complex coordinate to the nearest valid location on a curved road in that space. This is used for advanced cryptographic operations where you need to convert hash values or other data into G2 points, which are typically used for public keys in BLS signature schemes. The operation is much more computationally expensive than the G1 version because it's working in this more complex mathematical space, which is why it costs significantly more gas.

## EIP-2537 Specification

### Basic Operation
- **Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000011`
- **Gas Cost**: 110000 (fixed cost)
- **Input**: 128 bytes (field element in Fp2)
- **Output**: 256 bytes (G2 point)
- **Available**: Post-EIP-2537 hardforks

### Input Format
```
Input (128 bytes):
- Fp2 element: c0 (64 bytes) + c1 (64 bytes), big-endian
- c0: Real part of the field element
- c1: Imaginary part of the field element

Requirements:
- Both c0 and c1 must be valid Fp elements (< BLS12-381 prime modulus)
- Invalid field elements should cause the operation to fail
```

### Output Format
```
Output (256 bytes):
- G2 point in uncompressed format
- x_c0 (64 bytes): Real part of x coordinate
- x_c1 (64 bytes): Imaginary part of x coordinate
- y_c0 (64 bytes): Real part of y coordinate
- y_c1 (64 bytes): Imaginary part of y coordinate
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Field Validation**: Verify input is valid Fp2 element
2. **Hash-to-Curve**: Implement deterministic map from Fp2 to G2
3. **Point Validation**: Ensure output point is on curve and in subgroup
4. **Deterministic Mapping**: Same input always produces same output
5. **Error Handling**: Reject invalid field elements

### Files to Create/Modify
- `/src/evm/precompiles/bls12_381_map_fp2_to_g2.zig` - New MAP_FP2_TO_G2 implementation
- `/src/evm/crypto/bls12_381.zig` - Hash-to-curve operations for G2 (extend)
- `/src/evm/precompiles/precompiles.zig` - Add MAP_FP2_TO_G2 to dispatcher
- `/src/evm/precompiles/precompile_addresses.zig` - Add MAP_FP2_TO_G2 address
- `/src/evm/constants/gas_constants.zig` - Add MAP_FP2_TO_G2 gas cost
- `/test/evm/precompiles/bls12_381_map_fp2_to_g2_test.zig` - Comprehensive tests

## Success Criteria

1. **EIP-2537 Compliance**: Fully implements EIP-2537 MAP_FP2_TO_G2 specification
2. **Field Validation**: Correctly validates Fp2 field elements
3. **Mapping Correctness**: Produces valid G2 points from Fp2 elements
4. **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
5. **Gas Accuracy**: Consumes exactly 110000 gas per operation
6. **Integration**: Works with existing precompile infrastructure

## Critical Requirements

1. **NEVER commit until `zig build test-all` passes**
2. **Use established hash-to-curve libraries** - Very complex algorithm for G2
3. **Validate Fp2 elements** - Both components must be valid Fp elements
4. **Test with EIP test vectors** - Use official EIP-2537 test cases
5. **Ensure deterministic behavior** - Critical for consensus compatibility
