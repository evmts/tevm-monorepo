## Context

Implement the BLS12-381 G2 multi-scalar multiplication precompile (address 0x0E) as defined in EIP-2537. This precompile performs efficient multi-scalar multiplication operations on the G2 group of the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, operating over the extension field Fp2.

## ELI5

Imagine you have a bunch of locations on a curved surface (G2 points) and you want to "stretch" each location by different amounts (scalars), then add all the stretched results together. Multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) does exactly this - it takes many point-and-number pairs, multiplies each point by its number, then adds all the results together in one efficient operation. This is like having a super-calculator that can do "3Ã—Point1 + 7Ã—Point2 + 2Ã—Point3 + ..." all at once instead of doing each multiplication and addition separately. This operation is crucial for zero-knowledge proofs and advanced cryptographic protocols that need to process many G2 operations simultaneously. The precompile makes this batch operation much more efficient than doing individual multiplications and additions, which is essential for scalable blockchain applications.

## EIP-2537 Specification

### Basic Operation
- **Address**: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000E`
- **Gas Cost**: Variable based on input size and complexity
- **Input**: Multiple (scalar, G2 point) pairs for multi-scalar multiplication
- **Output**: Single G2 point result
- **Available**: Post-EIP-2537 hardforks

### Input Format
```
Input format (variable length):
- Each pair: 32 bytes (scalar) + 256 bytes (G2 point) = 288 bytes
- Total input must be multiple of 288 bytes
- Minimum: 288 bytes (1 pair)
- Maximum: Implementation dependent

G2 Point Format (256 bytes):
- x_c0 (64 bytes): Real part of x coordinate
- x_c1 (64 bytes): Imaginary part of x coordinate
- y_c0 (64 bytes): Real part of y coordinate
- y_c1 (64 bytes): Imaginary part of y coordinate
```

### Gas Calculation
```
base_cost = 55000
per_pair_cost = 32000
total_cost = base_cost + (num_pairs * per_pair_cost)
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Input Validation**: Verify G2 points are on curve and scalars are valid
2. **Multi-Scalar Multiplication**: Efficient MSM algorithm for G2 points
3. **Gas Calculation**: Accurate cost based on number of pairs
4. **Point Serialization**: Proper G2 point encoding/decoding over Fp2
5. **Error Handling**: Handle invalid points and out-of-gas conditions

### Files to Create/Modify
- `/src/evm/precompiles/bls12_381_g2msm.zig` - New G2MSM implementation
- `/src/evm/crypto/bls12_381.zig` - BLS12-381 curve operations (extend)
- `/src/evm/precompiles/precompiles.zig` - Add G2MSM to dispatcher
- `/src/evm/precompiles/precompile_addresses.zig` - Add G2MSM address
- `/src/evm/constants/gas_constants.zig` - Add G2MSM gas costs
- `/test/evm/precompiles/bls12_381_g2msm_test.zig` - Comprehensive tests

## Success Criteria

1. **EIP-2537 Compliance**: Fully implements EIP-2537 G2MSM specification
2. **Point Validation**: Correctly validates G2 points and subgroup membership
3. **MSM Correctness**: Produces correct multi-scalar multiplication results
4. **Gas Accuracy**: Implements correct gas pricing model for G2 operations
5. **Performance**: Efficient implementation suitable for production use
6. **Integration**: Works with existing precompile infrastructure

## Critical Requirements

1. **NEVER commit until `zig build test-all` passes**
2. **Use established BLS libraries** - Don't implement Fp2 arithmetic from scratch
3. **Validate subgroup membership** - G2 points must be in correct subgroup
4. **Test with EIP test vectors** - Use official EIP-2537 test cases
5. **Handle large inputs gracefully** - Prevent DoS via large G2 MSM operations
