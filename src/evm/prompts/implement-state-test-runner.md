# Implement State Test Runner

You are implementing State Test Runner for the Tevm EVM written in Zig. Your goal is to [specific objective] following Ethereum specifications and maintaining compatibility with existing implementations.

## Development Workflow
- **Branch**: `feat_implement_state_test_runner` (snake_case)
- **Worktree**: `git worktree add g/feat_implement_state_test_runner feat_implement_state_test_runner`
- **Testing**: Run `zig build test-all` before committing
- **Commit**: Use emoji conventional commits with XML summary format

## Branch Setup
1. **Create branch**: `feat_implement_state_test_runner` (snake_case, no emoji)
2. **Create worktree**: `git worktree add g/feat_implement_state_test_runner feat_implement_state_test_runner`
3. **Work in isolation**: `cd g/feat_implement_state_test_runner`
4. **Commit message**: Use the following XML format:

### Workflow Steps
1. Create and switch to the new worktree
2. Implement all changes in the isolated branch
3. Run `zig build test-all` to ensure all tests pass
4. Commit with emoji conventional commit format
5. DO NOT merge - leave ready for review

## Context

Implement a state test runner that can execute official Ethereum state tests. This enables comprehensive compatibility testing against the Ethereum Foundation's test suite, ensuring the EVM implementation correctly handles all edge cases and maintains consensus compatibility.

## ELI5

Imagine you're building a clone of a complex recipe and want to make sure it tastes exactly like the original. The state test runner is like having the master chef's official cookbook with thousands of precise test recipes - each one specifies exact ingredients (initial state), cooking steps (transactions), and what the final dish should look like (expected final state). By running our EVM through these official "cooking tests" from the Ethereum Foundation, we can verify that our implementation produces exactly the same results as the reference implementation, ensuring perfect compatibility with the real Ethereum network.

## Ethereum State Test Format

  }
}
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Test Loading**: Parse JSON state test files
2. **State Setup**: Initialize EVM state from pre-state
3. **Transaction Execution**: Execute test transactions
4. **Result Validation**: Compare against expected post-state
5. **Fork Support**: Handle tests across different hardforks
6. **Batch Processing**: Run multiple tests efficiently

### Files to Create/Modify
- `/src/evm/testing/state_test_runner.zig` - New state test runner
- `/src/evm/testing/test_parser.zig` - JSON test file parser
- `/src/evm/testing/state_validator.zig` - State comparison utilities
- `/src/evm/testing/test_types.zig` - Test data structures
- `/test/evm/state_tests/` - Directory for running actual state tests

### Test Runner Architecture
```zig
pub const StateTestRunner = struct {
    allocator: std.mem.Allocator,
    vm: *VM,
    
    pub fn run_test_file(self: *StateTestRunner, file_path: []const u8) !TestResults {
        const test_data = try self.parse_test_file(file_path);
        var results = TestResults.init(self.allocator);
        
        for (test_data.tests) |test| {
            const result = try self.run_single_test(test);
            try results.append(result);
        }
        
        return results;
    }
    
    fn run_single_test(self: *StateTestRunner, test: StateTest) !TestResult {
        // Setup pre-state
        try self.setup_pre_state(test.pre);
        
        // Execute transaction
        const tx_result = try self.execute_transaction(test.transaction, test.env);
        
        // Validate post-state
        const validation = try self.validate_post_state(test.post, tx_result.fork);
        
        return TestResult{
            .name = test.name,
            .passed = validation.passed,
            .expected_hash = validation.expected_hash,
            .actual_hash = validation.actual_hash,
            .error = validation.error,
        };
    }
};
```

## Success Criteria

1. **Test Compatibility**: Successfully runs official Ethereum state tests
2. **Fork Support**: Handles all hardforks from Frontier to latest
3. **Result Validation**: Accurately validates state root hashes and logs
4. **Error Reporting**: Provides detailed failure analysis
5. **Performance**: Efficiently processes large test suites
6. **Integration**: Works with existing EVM and state management

‚ùå DO NOT merge without review
‚úÖ MUST follow Zig style conventions (snake_case, no inline keyword)
‚úÖ MUST validate against Ethereum specifications exactly
‚úÖ MUST maintain compatibility with existing implementations
‚úÖ MUST handle all edge cases and error conditions

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ All tests pass with `zig build test-all`
