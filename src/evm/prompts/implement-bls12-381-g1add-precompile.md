# Implement BLS12-381 G1ADD Precompile

## What
<eli5>
Imagine you have special mathematical points on a curved surface, and you want to "add" two points together to get a third point. This isn't regular addition - it's a special kind of math used in advanced cryptography. BLS12-381 is a specific type of elliptic curve that's really good for creating digital signatures that multiple parties can combine together. The G1 point addition precompile is like having a built-in calculator in Ethereum that can do this special curve math super efficiently. This is essential for things like proof systems and advanced signature schemes that help make blockchain more scalable and private.
</eli5>

Implement BLS12-381 G1 point addition precompile (EIP-2537) that performs elliptic curve point addition on the BLS12-381 G1 group. Takes 256 bytes input (two 128-byte G1 points) and returns 128 bytes output (resulting G1 point) with fixed gas cost of 375.

## Why
BLS12-381 G1 point addition is fundamental for BLS signature verification, zero-knowledge proof systems, and other advanced cryptographic protocols. This precompile provides efficient elliptic curve operations that would be prohibitively expensive to implement in EVM bytecode, enabling scalable cryptographic applications on Ethereum.

## How
1. Implement BLS12-381 field arithmetic for 381-bit prime field operations
2. Add G1 point decoding/encoding with proper validation
3. Implement elliptic curve point addition using optimized algorithms
4. Handle point at infinity (identity element) correctly
5. Validate all input points are on the correct curve and in correct subgroup
6. Optimize performance for the specific BLS12-381 curve parameters

<explanation>
The go-ethereum implementation shows the standard BLS12-381 G1 point addition pattern: constant gas cost (375), strict input validation (256 bytes exactly), point decoding/validation, curve arithmetic using the consensys/gnark-crypto library, and proper encoding of the result. The key insight is that it uses a well-tested external crypto library for the complex elliptic curve operations.

```go
// bls12381G1Add implements EIP-2537 G1Add precompile.

	// Implements EIP-2537 G1Add precompile.
	// > G1 addition call expects `256` bytes as an input that is interpreted as byte concatenation of two G1 points (`128` bytes each).
	// > Output is an encoding of addition operation result - single G1 point (`128` bytes).
	if len(input) != 256 {
		return nil, errBLS12381InvalidInputLength
	}
	var err error
	var p0, p1 *bls12381.G1Affine

	// Decode G1 point p_0
	if p0, err = decodePointG1(input[:128]); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	// Decode G1 point p_1
	if p1, err = decodePointG1(input[128:]); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	// No need to check the subgroup here, as specified by EIP-2537

	// Compute r = p_0 + p_1
	p0.Add(p0, p1)

	// Encode the G1 point result into 128 bytes
	return encodePointG1(p0), nil
