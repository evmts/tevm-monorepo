>>>>>>> origin/main
Implement BLS12-381 G1 point addition precompile (EIP-2537) that performs elliptic curve point addition on the BLS12-381 G1 group. Takes 256 bytes input (two 128-byte G1 points) and returns 128 bytes output (resulting G1 point) with fixed gas cost of 375.

## Why
BLS12-381 G1 point addition is fundamental for BLS signature verification, zero-knowledge proof systems, and other advanced cryptographic protocols. This precompile provides efficient elliptic curve operations that would be prohibitively expensive to implement in EVM bytecode, enabling scalable cryptographic applications on Ethereum.

## How
1. Implement BLS12-381 field arithmetic for 381-bit prime field operations
2. Add G1 point decoding/encoding with proper validation
3. Implement elliptic curve point addition using optimized algorithms
4. Handle point at infinity (identity element) correctly
5. Validate all input points are on the correct curve and in correct subgroup
6. Optimize performance for the specific BLS12-381 curve parameters

## Development Workflow
- **Branch**: `feat_implement_bls` (snake_case)
- **Worktree**: `git worktree add g/feat_implement_bls feat_implement_bls`
- **Testing**: Run `zig build test-all` before committing
- **Commit**: Use emoji conventional commits with XML summary format


## Context

Implement BLS12-381 G1 point addition precompile for EIP-2537 support. This precompile enables efficient elliptic curve operations on the BLS12-381 curve.

## ELI5

Think of BLS12-381 G1 addition like a special calculator that can add points on a curved surface (imagine adding coordinates on a globe, but with more complex math). This isn't regular addition - it's "elliptic curve addition" which follows special rules.

Here's what it does:
- **Takes two points** on the BLS12-381 curve (each point has x,y coordinates, but they're very large numbers)
- **Adds them together** using special mathematical rules for elliptic curves
- **Returns the result point** that represents their sum on the curve

Why this matters:
- **BLS Signatures**: These operations are building blocks for BLS signatures used in Ethereum 2.0
- **Advanced Cryptography**: Enables privacy-preserving protocols and multi-party computations
- **Efficient Operations**: Having this as a precompile makes it much faster and cheaper than doing the math in regular smart contract code

Real-world analogy:
- Like having a specialized GPS calculator that can compute complex navigation between two points on a curved Earth
- Instead of doing all the spherical trigonometry yourself, you use a built-in function
- The math is complex, but the interface is simple: "add these two points"

This specific precompile (G1ADD) is one piece of a larger cryptographic toolkit. G1 refers to one of two groups of points on the BLS12-381 curve - think of it as one "layer" of the mathematical structure that makes advanced cryptography possible.

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING: DO NOT IMPLEMENT CUSTOM CRYPTO

**‚ùå NEVER IMPLEMENT CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS FROM SCRATCH**

This prompt involves BLS12-381 elliptic curve cryptography. Follow these security principles:

### ‚úÖ **DO THIS:**
- **Use established crypto libraries** (blst, noble-curves BLS12-381, arkworks-rs)
- **Import proven implementations** from well-audited libraries
- **Follow reference implementations** from go-ethereum, revm, evmone exactly
- **Use official test vectors** from EIP-2537 specification
- **Implement constant-time algorithms** to prevent timing attacks
- **Validate all curve points** are on the correct curve and in correct subgroup

### ‚ùå **NEVER DO THIS:**
- Write your own BLS12-381 curve arithmetic or field operations
- Implement elliptic curve operations "from scratch" or "for learning"
- Modify cryptographic algorithms or add "optimizations"
- Copy-paste crypto code from tutorials or unofficial sources
- Implement crypto without extensive peer review and testing
- Skip subgroup checks or point validation

### üéØ **Implementation Strategy:**
1. **First choice**: Use blst library (industry standard for BLS12-381)
2. **Second choice**: Use noble-curves BLS12-381 (WASM compatible)
3. **Third choice**: Bind to arkworks-rs or other audited Rust crypto libraries
4. **Never**: Write custom BLS12-381 curve implementations

**Remember**: BLS12-381 is critical for Ethereum 2.0 and advanced cryptographic protocols. Bugs can compromise validator operations, break signature aggregation, and undermine consensus security. Always use proven, audited implementations.

## File Structure

**Primary Files to Modify:**
- `/src/evm/precompiles/precompiles.zig` - Main precompile dispatcher
- `/src/evm/precompiles/precompile_addresses.zig` - Address constants
- `/src/evm/hardforks/chain_rules.zig` - Hardfork availability rules

**Supporting Files:**
- `/src/evm/precompiles/precompile_gas.zig` - Gas calculation for precompiles
- `/src/evm/precompiles/precompile_result.zig` - Result types for precompile execution

**New Files to Create:**
- `/src/evm/precompiles/bls12_381_g1_add.zig` - BLS12-381 G1 addition implementation

**Test Files:**
- `/test/evm/precompiles/` (directory) - Precompile test infrastructure
- `/test/evm/precompiles/bls12_381_g1_add_test.zig` - BLS12-381 G1 addition specific tests

**Why These Files:**
- The main precompile dispatcher needs to route calls to the new BLS12-381 G1 addition implementation
- Address constants define the precompile address (0x0b for G1 addition)
- Chain rules determine when this precompile becomes available (Berlin hardfork)
- New implementation file handles the complex elliptic curve mathematics
- Comprehensive tests ensure EIP-2537 compliance

- Verify cryptographic correctness with known vectors

### Test-First Examples

**Before writing any implementation:**
```zig
test "bls12_381_g1_add basic functionality" {
    // This test MUST fail initially
    const input = test_vectors.valid_curve_points;
    const expected = test_vectors.expected_result;
    
    const result = bls12_381_g1_add.run(input);
    try testing.expectEqualSlices(u8, expected, result);
}
```

**Only then implement:**
```zig
pub fn run(input: []const u8) ![]u8 {
    // Minimal implementation to make test pass
    return error.NotImplemented; // Initially
}
```

### Critical Testing Notes
- **Cryptographic correctness is paramount** - Never compromise on test coverage
- **Test against malicious inputs** - Elliptic curve operations are security-critical
- **Verify constant-time execution** - Prevent timing attack vulnerabilities
- **Test hardfork transitions** - Ensure availability at correct block numbers

## Reference Implementations

### geth

<explanation>
The go-ethereum implementation shows the standard BLS12-381 G1 point addition pattern: constant gas cost (375), strict input validation (256 bytes exactly), point decoding/validation, curve arithmetic using the consensys/gnark-crypto library, and proper encoding of the result. The key insight is that it uses a well-tested external crypto library for the complex elliptic curve operations.
