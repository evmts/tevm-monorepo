/// Advanced code analysis for EVM bytecode optimization.
///
/// This structure holds pre-computed analysis results for a contract's bytecode,
/// enabling efficient execution by pre-identifying jump destinations, code segments,
/// and other properties that would otherwise need to be computed at runtime.
///
/// The analysis is performed once when a contract is first loaded and cached for
/// subsequent executions, significantly improving performance for frequently-used
/// contracts.
///
/// ## Fields
/// - `code_segments`: Bit vector marking which bytes are executable code vs data
/// - `jumpdest_positions`: Sorted array of valid JUMPDEST positions for O(log n) validation
/// - `block_gas_costs`: Optional pre-computed gas costs for basic blocks
/// - `max_stack_depth`: Maximum stack depth required by the contract
/// - `has_dynamic_jumps`: Whether the code contains JUMP/JUMPI with dynamic targets
/// - `has_static_jumps`: Whether the code contains JUMP/JUMPI with static targets
/// - `has_selfdestruct`: Whether the code contains SELFDESTRUCT opcode
/// - `has_create`: Whether the code contains CREATE/CREATE2 opcodes
///
/// ## Performance
/// - Jump destination validation: O(log n) using binary search
/// - Code segment checking: O(1) using bit vector
/// - Enables dead code elimination and other optimizations
///
/// ## Memory Management
/// The analysis owns its allocated memory and must be properly cleaned up
/// using the `deinit` method to prevent memory leaks.

/// Bit vector marking which bytes in the bytecode are executable code vs data.
/// 
/// Each bit corresponds to a byte in the contract bytecode:
/// - 1 = executable code byte
/// - 0 = data byte (e.g., PUSH arguments)
///
/// This is critical for JUMPDEST validation since jump destinations
/// must point to actual code, not data bytes within PUSH instructions.
code_segments: bitvec,

/// Sorted array of all valid JUMPDEST positions in the bytecode.
///
/// Pre-sorted to enable O(log n) binary search validation of jump targets.
/// Only positions marked as code (not data) and containing the JUMPDEST
/// opcode (0x5B) are included.
jumpdest_positions: []const u32,

/// Optional pre-computed gas costs for each basic block.
///
/// When present, enables advanced gas optimization by pre-calculating
/// the gas cost of straight-line code sequences between jumps.
/// This is an optional optimization that may not be computed for all contracts.
block_gas_costs: ?[]const u32,

/// Maximum stack depth required by any execution path in the contract.
///
/// Pre-computed through static analysis to enable early detection of
/// stack overflow conditions. A value of 0 indicates the depth wasn't analyzed.
max_stack_depth: u16,

/// Indicates whether the contract contains JUMP/JUMPI opcodes with dynamic targets.
///
/// Dynamic jumps (where the target is computed at runtime) prevent certain
/// optimizations and require full jump destination validation at runtime.
has_dynamic_jumps: bool,

/// Indicates whether the contract contains JUMP/JUMPI opcodes with static targets.
///
/// Static jumps (where the target is a constant) can be pre-validated
/// and optimized during analysis.
has_static_jumps: bool,

/// Indicates whether the contract contains the SELFDESTRUCT opcode (0xFF).
///
/// Contracts with SELFDESTRUCT require special handling for state management
/// and cannot be marked as "pure" or side-effect free.
has_selfdestruct: bool,

/// Indicates whether the contract contains CREATE or CREATE2 opcodes.
///
/// Contracts that can deploy other contracts require additional
/// gas reservation and state management considerations.
has_create: bool,

/// Releases all memory allocated by this code analysis.
///
/// This method must be called when the analysis is no longer needed to prevent
/// memory leaks. It safely handles all owned resources including:
/// - The code segments bit vector
/// - The jumpdest positions array
/// - The optional block gas costs array
///
/// ## Parameters
/// - `self`: The analysis instance to clean up
/// - `allocator`: The same allocator used to create the analysis resources
///
/// ## Safety
/// After calling deinit, the analysis instance should not be used again.
/// All pointers to analysis data become invalid.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```zig
/// var analysis = try analyzeCode(allocator, bytecode);
/// defer analysis.deinit(allocator);
/// ```
