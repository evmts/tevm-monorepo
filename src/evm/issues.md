## Priority 0: Critical Issues (Must Fix Immediately)

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Issues

#### ISSUE-001: Fix Import Organization

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: All opcode files + jump_table.zig
- **Description**: Imports are missing or incorrectly placed. Frame import is at bottom of jump_table.zig
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Files Affected**: All files in src/evm/opcodes/, jump_table.zig
- **Resolution**: Fixed Frame import location in jump_table.zig. Note: Address imports in opcodes need to use @import("Address") module syntax to avoid conflicts

#### ISSUE-002: Add Missing u256 Type Import

- **Status**: Canceled
- **Component**: All opcode files
- **Description**: u256 type is used throughout but never imported
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Solution**: Add `const u256 = @import("../types.zig").u256;` or similar
- **Resolution**: u256 is a built-in type in Zig (unsigned 256-bit integer) and doesn't require import

#### ISSUE-003: Define VM Interface

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: Core infrastructure
- **Description**: Opcodes reference VM methods that don't exist
- **Effort**: 4 hours
- **Required Methods**:
  ```zig
  get_storage(address: Address, slot: u256) u256
  set_storage(address: Address, slot: u256, value: u256) void
  get_balance(address: Address) u256
  get_code(address: Address) []const u8
  create_contract(...) CreateResult
  call_contract(...) CallResult
  get_transient_storage(address: Address, slot: u256) u256
  set_transient_storage(address: Address, slot: u256, value: u256) void
  ```
- **Resolution**: All required VM interface methods have been added to vm.zig including storage, balance, code, transient storage, and placeholder methods for contract creation/calling. Fixed Address import to use package module syntax.

#### ISSUE-004: Complete Frame Structure

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: frame.zig
- **Description**: Frame is missing required fields
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Missing Fields**:
  - `return_data_buffer: []u8`
  - `input: []const u8`
  - `depth: u32`
  - `is_static: bool`
- **Resolution**: All fields have been added to the Frame structure. Changed return_data_buffer from []const u8 to []u8 to allow mutation, and changed depth from u16 to u32 as specified. Updated init_with_state function to include all new fields as optional parameters.

### üî• Critical Opcode Issues

  - Updated all storage opcodes (SLOAD, SSTORE, TLOAD, TSTORE) to use actual VM storage
  - Fixed error handling to map OutOfMemory errors to OutOfGas
  - Fixed VM's interpreter/state pointer casting to pass VM as interpreter

#### ISSUE-006: Environment Opcodes Return Hardcoded Values

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: environment.zig
- **Description**: BALANCE, ORIGIN, CALLER, etc. return placeholder values
- **Effort**: 6 hours
- **Impact**: Contracts cannot access basic environment data
- **Resolution**: Updated all environment opcodes to use actual VM state:
  - op_balance: Gets balance from vm.balances
  - op_origin: Returns vm.tx_origin
  - op_gasprice: Returns vm.gas_price
  - op_extcodesize: Gets code size from vm.code

#### ISSUE-007: Block Opcodes Return Hardcoded Values

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: block.zig
- **Description**: TIMESTAMP returns 1, NUMBER returns 0, etc.
- **Effort**: 4 hours
- **Impact**: Time-dependent contracts broken
- **Resolution**: Updated all block opcodes to use VM block context fields. Added blob_hashes and blob_base_fee fields to VM structure for EIP-4844 support.

#### ISSUE-008: Call Operations Not Implemented

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: system.zig
- **Description**: CALL, DELEGATECALL, STATICCALL, CREATE are stubs
- **Effort**: 8 hours
- **Impact**: No contract interaction possible
- **Resolution**:
  - Completed STATICCALL implementation to match CALL but with is_static=true
  - All call operations (CREATE, CREATE2, CALL, CALLCODE, DELEGATECALL, STATICCALL) now properly:
    - Check call depth (1024 limit)
    - Get arguments from memory
    - Ensure memory is allocated for return data
    - Calculate gas to give to the called contract
    - Call the appropriate VM method
    - Update gas remaining after the call
    - Write return data to memory
    - Set return_data_buffer
    - Push success/failure status to stack
  - Note: The actual VM methods (create_contract, call_contract, etc.) are still placeholders and would need separate implementation

### ‚õΩ Gas Accounting Issues

#### ISSUE-009: Dynamic Gas Not Consumed

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: All opcode files
- **Description**: Gas is calculated but never consumed via frame.gas.consume()
- **Effort**: 4 hours
- **Example**: EXP calculates gas_cost but doesn't consume it
- **Resolution**: Fixed missing gas consumption for memory expansion:
  - log.zig: Added memory expansion gas calculation for op_log0-4 operations
  - control.zig: Added memory expansion gas to op_revert (op_return already had it)
  - system.zig: Added memory expansion gas to op_create and op_create2
  - Note: Other operations (op_extcodecopy, op_calldatacopy, op_codecopy, op_returndatacopy, op_call) already had proper gas consumption
  - All memory operations now correctly calculate and consume memory expansion gas using gas_constants.memory_gas_cost()

#### ISSUE-010: Missing Gas Consumption in Jump Table

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: jump_table.zig
- **Description**: execute() method should consume base gas before calling handler
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Resolution**: Added execute() method to JumpTable that consumes base gas from frame.gas_remaining before calling the opcode handler. Updated VM to use table.execute() instead of directly calling operation.execute(). Added test to verify gas consumption.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### ISSUE-027: Fix PC Manipulation in PUSH Operations

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: stack.zig, vm.zig, operation.zig, jump_table.zig
- **Description**: PUSH ops modify PC which may conflict with VM loop
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Resolution**:
  - Modified Operation module to return ExecutionResult struct instead of just output data
  - ExecutionResult includes bytes_consumed field (default 1) and output field
  - Updated all PUSH operations to return bytes_consumed = 1 + n (where n is the number of data bytes)
  - Updated VM's interpret function to advance PC by result.bytes_consumed instead of always 1
  - Updated jump_table.execute() and all control flow operations to use ExecutionResult
  - This properly handles PC advancement for variable-length PUSH instructions without conflicts

#### ISSUE-028: Fix Memory Allocation in RETURN/REVERT

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: control.zig
- **Description**: Unbounded allocation is potential DOS vector
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Resolution**:
  - Removed unnecessary allocation and memcpy in op_return and op_revert
  - The memory gas cost calculation already protects against excessive memory use
  - Changed to directly reference the memory slice instead of allocating a separate buffer
  - The VM layer should handle copying the data when needed (e.g., when returning to caller)
  - This eliminates the DOS vector while maintaining correct behavior

#### ISSUE-029: Fix Address Type Usage

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: contract.zig, environment.zig
- **Description**: Inconsistent Address type usage and imports

    - Stack.Error.Overflow ‚Üí ExecutionError.Error.StackOverflow
    - Stack.Error.OutOfBounds ‚Üí ExecutionError.Error.StackUnderflow (correct for DUP/SWAP)
    - Stack.Error.InvalidPosition ‚Üí ExecutionError.Error.StackUnderflow (correct for DUP/SWAP)
  - Memory errors are properly mapped:
    - All MemoryError types ‚Üí ExecutionError.Error.OutOfOffset
  - VM storage/balance errors are properly mapped:
    - error.OutOfMemory ‚Üí ExecutionError.Error.OutOfGas
  - All error mappings follow a consistent pattern using catch blocks with switch statements
  - The mappings are semantically correct for EVM execution context

## Priority 2: Medium Priority Issues

### üèóÔ∏è Code Quality

#### ISSUE-041: Standardize Error Handling

- **Component**: All files
- **Description**: Consistent error types and handling patterns
- **Effort**: 4 hours

#### ISSUE-042: Remove All TODO Comments

- **Component**: All files
- **Description**: Replace TODOs with actual implementations
- **Effort**: Included in other issues

#### ISSUE-043: Add Inline Documentation

- **Component**: Complex operations
- **Description**: Document complex gas calculations and edge cases
- **Effort**: 3 hours

#### ISSUE-048: Remove inline from opcode methods

- **Component**: All opcode files
- **Description**: Remove the inline keyword from opcode-related methods and let the compiler decide on inlining
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Rationale**: The compiler is generally smarter than us at deciding what to inline. Manual inline hints can actually hurt performance by causing code bloat and instruction cache misses. We may add inline back later for specific hot paths after profiling, but should start without it.

- **Description**: Reduce code indentation and improve linear readability through early returns and guard clauses
- **Effort**: 3 hours
- **Rationale**: This is purely a stylistic change to improve code readability without changing behavior. The goal is to reduce nesting levels by using early returns, continue statements, and guard clauses. For example:

  ```zig
  // Instead of:
  if (condition) {
      // lots of indented code
      if (another_condition) {
          // even more indented code
      }
  }

  // Prefer:
  if (!condition) return;
  // code at lower indentation
  if (!another_condition) return;
  // more code at lower indentation
  ```

  This pattern makes code easier to read linearly, reduces cognitive load, and makes the happy path more obvious. Apply to while loops, if statements, and any control flow that creates deep nesting.

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

#### ISSUE-034: Implement Batched Stack Operations

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: Stack operations
- **Description**: Add pop2_push1 style optimizations
- **Effort**: 4 hours
- **Resolution**: Implemented comprehensive batched stack operations:
  - Added pop2_push1 and pop3_push1 for binary/ternary operations
  - Added pop1_push1 for unary operations that transform values
  - Added pop2 for comparison operations that don't push results
  - Included unsafe variants for hot paths with pre-validated stacks
  - Added specialized swap1_optimized and dup1_optimized for common cases
  - Added push_batch for multiple value insertion
  - Added peek_multiple for non-destructive multi-value access
  - Created arithmetic_optimized.zig demonstrating usage patterns
  - Added comprehensive test suite in stack_batched_test.zig
  - Integrated tests into build system
  - These optimizations reduce memory operations and improve cache locality

#### ISSUE-035: Add Cache-Line Alignment

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: jump_table.zig
- **Description**: Align jump table for better cache performance
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Resolution**: Implemented cache-line alignment optimizations:
  - Added CACHE_LINE_SIZE constant (64 bytes) for modern processor optimization
  - Aligned jump table array to cache line boundary using align(64) attribute
  - Marked get_operation function as inline for hot path optimization
  - Added comprehensive documentation explaining performance benefits
  - Created tests to verify alignment and cache characteristics
  - The 256-entry jump table now uses exactly 32 cache lines (2048 bytes)
  - Frequently used opcodes cluster in early cache lines for better locality

#### ISSUE-036: Create Unsafe Operation Variants

- **Status**: Cancelled
- **Component**: Stack/Memory operations
- **Description**: Add unsafe variants for hot paths
- **Effort**: 4 hours
- **Reason**: Not a requirement for initial launch. The current implementation with proper error handling is sufficient for the initial release. Unsafe variants can be added later after profiling identifies actual hot paths.

#### ISSUE-037: Optimize 256-bit Arithmetic

- **Status**: Cancelled
- **Component**: arithmetic.zig
- **Description**: Use specialized 256-bit math library
- **Effort**: 6 hours
- **Reason**: Not a requirement for initial launch. Zig's built-in u256 type provides adequate performance for the initial release. Specialized 256-bit math optimizations can be added later if profiling shows arithmetic operations are a bottleneck.

### üîí Security Enhancements

#### ISSUE-038: Add Stack Depth Validation

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: All opcode files
- **Description**: Ensure stack depth limits are enforced
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Resolution**: Implemented comprehensive stack depth validation:
  - Created stack_validation.zig module with validation functions
  - Added validate_stack_requirements to check min_stack and max_stack before opcode execution
  - Integrated validation into jump_table.execute() method
  - Added helper functions for common patterns (binary, ternary, unary operations)
  - Created calculate_max_stack function to compute proper max_stack values
  - Added ValidationPatterns struct for specialized validations (DUP, SWAP, PUSH)
  - Created comprehensive test suite in stack_validation_test.zig
  - Integrated tests into build system
  - Verified that PUSH operations already have correct max_stack (CAPACITY - 1)
  - Stack validation now happens automatically before every opcode execution

#### ISSUE-039: Add Memory Limit Enforcement

- **Component**: memory.zig
- **Description**: Prevent excessive memory allocation
- **Effort**: 2 hours

#### ISSUE-040: Add Static Call Protection Validation

- **Status**: Complete
- **Component**: All write operations
- **Description**: Ensure all state modifications check is_static
- **Effort**: 3 hours
- **Resolution**: Implemented comprehensive static call protection in vm.zig:
  - Added validate_static_context() method to check read_only flag
  - Added protected versions of all state-modifying methods
  - Added interpret_static() and interpret_with_context() for proper context propagation
  - All opcodes already check frame.is_static before state modifications
  - Created comprehensive test suite in static_call_protection_test.zig
  - Added documentation in STATIC_CALL_PROTECTION.md
  - Integrated tests into build system

### üîß Additional Features

#### ISSUE-044: Add Opcode Tracing Support

- **Status**: Out of Scope
- **Component**: jump_table.zig
- **Description**: Hook for debugging/tracing opcode execution
- **Effort**: 3 hours
- **Reason**: Out of scope for this implementation. Tracing functionality should be handled at a higher level in the execution environment.

#### ISSUE-045: Add Benchmark Suite

- **Status**: Out of Scope
- **Component**: benchmarks/
- **Description**: Performance benchmarks for optimization
- **Effort**: 4 hours
- **Reason**: Out of scope for this implementation. We are using Snail Trail for performance analysis instead of traditional benchmarking.

#### ISSUE-048: Remove inline from opcode methods

- **Component**: All opcode files
- **Description**: Remove the inline keyword from opcode-related methods and let the compiler decide on inlining
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Rationale**: The compiler is generally smarter than us at deciding what to inline. Manual inline hints can actually hurt performance by causing code bloat and instruction cache misses. We may add inline back later for specific hot paths after profiling, but should start without it.
