/// EVM gas cost constants for opcode execution
///
/// This module defines all gas cost constants used in EVM execution according
/// to the Ethereum Yellow Paper and various EIPs. Gas costs are critical for
/// preventing denial-of-service attacks and fairly pricing computational resources.
///
/// ## Gas Cost Categories
///
/// Operations are grouped by computational complexity:
/// - **Quick** (2 gas): Trivial operations like PC, MSIZE, GAS
/// - **Fastest** (3 gas): Simple arithmetic like ADD, SUB, NOT, LT, GT
/// - **Fast** (5 gas): More complex arithmetic like MUL, DIV, MOD
/// - **Mid** (8 gas): Advanced arithmetic like ADDMOD, MULMOD, SIGNEXTEND
/// - **Slow** (10 gas): Operations requiring more computation
/// - **Ext** (20+ gas): External operations like BALANCE, EXTCODESIZE
///
/// ## Historical Changes
///
/// Gas costs have evolved through various EIPs:
/// - EIP-150: Increased costs for IO-heavy operations
/// - EIP-2200: SSTORE net gas metering
/// - EIP-2929: Increased costs for cold storage/account access
/// - EIP-3529: Reduced refunds and cold access costs
/// - EIP-3860: Initcode metering
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```zig
