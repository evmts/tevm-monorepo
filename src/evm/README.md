# Tevm EVM - Blazingly Fast Zig Implementation

A high-performance Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation written in Zig, designed for both native and WebAssembly environments.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Tevm EVM is fully MIT licensed and aims to achieve three major goals:

1. **Best in class performance** - Leveraging Zig's zero hidden control flow and explicit memory management
2. **Smallest bundle size** - Optimized for WebAssembly deployment in JavaScript applications
3. **Feature complete and easy to maintain** - Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns

## 🔧 Build targets

Oftentimes size vs speed is a tradeoff. Much of other EVM wasm bundle size can be attributed to this tradeoff.

The zig build can be optimized for different tradeoffs

- Debug - Warns on undefined behavior and includes logging
- ReleaseFast - Optimizes for speed. Recomended for server apps that need the perf
- ReleaseSmall - Optimizes for small sizes. Recomended for WASM in browser
- ReleaseSafe - Optimizes for memory safety. Recomended for those who don't care about speed or perf

## 🚀 Why Zig?

The Zig programming language has proven to be an exceptional choice for this project:

- **Performance**: Zero hidden control flow and allocations make optimizing performance straightforward
- **Bundle Size**: Significantly better than Rust and Golang for building tiny WASM bundles
- **Maintainability**: Nearly as productive as Golang and JavaScript, making it enjoyable to read and write
- **Flexibility**: Architecture allows compiler optimization for either performance (inlining) or size

### Why not Rust?

Tevm originally planned on using revm. Revm has the following problems:

- **Bundle Size** Revm is only optimized for performance and not as much optimized for size including lots of inline and an api that bundles lots of unused code into final bundle
- **Wasm** Experimentation is showing zig to be a more ergonomic choice for wasm
- **C integration** Zig has first-class c integration giving it all of the C ecosystem first class as well as ability to interop with rust code too in a pinch
- **Dev velocity** We have found ourselves able to ship very fast with zig
- **Performance** Zig makes optimizing performance easy because of it's 0 hidden control flow or allocations making teh code so explicit about what is happening at a low level

### Why not JS?

Tevm is currently built on Ethereumjs. This migration to zig will have following impact

- [100x perf](https://github.com/ziyadedher/evm-bench)
- Smaller bundle size (we are optimizing for it up front)
- Complete control over the EVM with verticle integration with all of Tevm

## 🏃 Running the Project

```bash
# Build the project
zig build

# Run all tests (669 tests)
zig build test-all

# Run specific test suites
zig build test-evm        # EVM core tests
zig build test-opcodes    # Opcode implementation tests
zig build test-stack      # Stack tests
zig build test-memory     # Memory tests
zig build test-gas        # Gas accounting tests
```

All test and build targets are configured in build.zig. If an import isn't working you may need to add it there.

## Learning zig

Zig is pretty easy especially if you have used a memory managed language in the past. Here is what I did to learn it

1. [ziglings](https://ziglings.org/) to learn basic syntax
2. Skim through [std library docs](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/)
3. Write zig and ask AI questions as I go. The entire [zig language docs](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.1/) fits in context.
4. Read zig code from std library and other OSS code. Avoid Bun, however, as that project is a bit harder to read and understand.

## 🤖 AI

Use both the root CLAUDE.md and src/evm/CLAUDE.md in your claude and cursor environments. They have important rules for the AI for this project.

AI is decent at zig but it does hallucinate sometimes. It's not a big deal if you understand zig well. If you aren't comfy with zig consider sharign [zig language docs](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.1/) anytime the ai isn't using zig right. They are small enough to almost always fit in context.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The EVM implementation follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **VM Layer** (`vm.zig`) - Orchestrates execution, manages call stack, handles gas accounting
2. **Frame Layer** (`frame.zig`) - Represents individual execution contexts with their own stack, memory, and PC
3. **Execution Layer** (`execution/`) - Individual opcode implementations following a consistent pattern
4. **State Layer** (`state/`) - Manages accounts, storage, and logs with support for transient storage
5. **Validation Layer** - Pre-execution validation ensures safety, allowing optimized unsafe operations

### Performance Optimizations

- **Two-stage safety system**: Pre-validation + unsafe execution for maximum performance
- **Batch operations**: Combine multiple stack operations (e.g., `pop2_push1_unsafe`)
- **In-place modifications**: Direct memory access patterns where safe
- **Jump destination caching**: O(log n) JUMPDEST validation
- **Storage pooling**: Reuse hash maps across executions

## 🔮 Roadmap

### Recent Progress ✅

1. **Complete call gas management** with 63/64th gas forwarding rule ✅
2. **Implement precompiled contracts** - 13/17 completed including all standard precompiles ✅
3. **Add gas refunds** for SSTORE operations ✅
4. **Snailtracer benchmarking** against Geth and Reth ✅
5. **CI/CD checks** for WASM bundle size regression ✅

### Current Priorities

1. **Fix WASM build** and integrate into Tevm JavaScript library
2. **Complete remaining BLS12-381 precompiles** (PAIRING, MAP_FP_TO_G1, MAP_FP2_TO_G2)
3. **L2 support** for Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.
4. **Performance optimizations** and SIMD improvements
5. **EOF support** for future Ethereum upgrades
