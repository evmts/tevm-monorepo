# Tevm Tools Solidity Debugger UI Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a modern, responsive UI for the Tevm Solidity Debugger. The implementation focuses on creating a seamless debugging experience with a professional, developer-focused interface.

## Key Features

- **Dark Theme Design**: Consistent dark theme with high contrast for readability
- **Resizable Panels**: Drag handles for customizing layout during debugging sessions
- **Monaco Editor Integration**: Enhanced code editor with breakpoints and execution highlighting
- **Inspector Views**: Various panels for examining contract state, storage, call stack, and variables
- **Command Palette**: Keyboard-accessible command interface (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K)
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining usability

## Components

### Layout Components

- **HeaderBar**: Contains debugging controls, logo, and action buttons
- **Sidebar**: File explorer and code outline with resizable panel
- **MainArea**: Monaco editor and console with adjustable split
- **InspectorDrawer**: Slide-in panel for examining execution context

### Debug Components

- **EditorPane**: Enhanced Monaco editor with breakpoint and execution visualization
- **ConsolePane**: Filtered log output with various message types
- **Variables/Storage Views**: Inspection of contract state and local variables
- **CallStack/Watch Views**: Execution tracking and expression watching

## Technologies Used

- **Svelte**: Component framework for reactive UI
- **Monaco Editor**: Code editing with language support for Solidity
- **CSS Variables**: Consistent theming across components
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Responsive and resizable layout

## Design Principles

- **Dark Theme Aesthetic**: Deep colors with high contrast for code readability
- **Spatial Hierarchy**: Clear visual hierarchy with generous spacing
- **Contextual Information**: Inline visualizations of execution state
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information revealed progressively

## Future Enhancements

- **Theme Switching**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Persistent Layout**: Save and restore panel sizes and arrangement
- **Performance Optimization**: Virtualized lists for large data sets
- **User Preferences**: Customize editor settings and UI behavior
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Complete ARIA implementation

## Implementation Notes

The implementation is designed to integrate with the existing Tevm codebase while providing a significantly enhanced debugging experience. The UI is currently using mock data for demonstration purposes but is structured to easily connect to the real Tevm debugging functionality.

The design takes inspiration from modern debugging tools like Chrome DevTools and VS Code, with specific optimizations for Solidity and Ethereum development workflows.
