### #2038: Fix TypeScript error in TevmJsonRpcRequestHandler.ts

**Problem:** TypeScript error TS2344 in `packages/actions/src/tevm-request-handler/TevmJsonRpcRequestHandler.ts` line 106. The type constraint on `JsonRpcReturnTypeFromMethod<TRequest['method']>` was failing because `anvil_enableTraces` and `anvil_mineDetailed` were present in `AnvilJsonRpcRequest` but missing from `AnvilReturnType`.

**Root Cause:** When the JSON-RPC feature parity work added new anvil methods (`anvil_enableTraces` and `anvil_mineDetailed`) to `AnvilJsonRpcRequest.ts`, the corresponding entries were not added to `AnvilReturnType.ts`. This caused the generic constraint to fail since the request type included methods that weren't mapped in the return type.

**Solution:** Added the missing method mappings to `packages/actions/src/tevm-request-handler/AnvilReturnType.ts`:
- Import: `AnvilEnableTracesJsonRpcResponse`, `AnvilMineDetailedJsonRpcResponse`
- Mapping: `anvil_enableTraces: AnvilEnableTracesJsonRpcResponse`
- Mapping: `anvil_mineDetailed: AnvilMineDetailedJsonRpcResponse`

## Remaining Open Issues

From the original list:
- #2036: JSON-RPC Feature Parity Tracking (tracking issue)
- #2024: Implement `anvil_reorg` method
- #2023: Implement blob-related methods
- #1966: Missing support for EIP-7702
- #1946: Implement `eth_simulateV2`
- #1941: extensions/test-node custom passthrough
- #1931: Implement erc7562Tracer
- #1747: @tevm/test-matchers (tracking issue)
- #1591: Deno install hang
- #1385: Inline sol
- #1350: Add network import support

## Notes

- The build still shows pre-existing TypeScript errors in other files (ethGetBlockReceiptsHandler.js, ethNewFilterHandler.js, etc.) related to `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and type mismatches. These are separate issues not related to #2038.
- All tests for the affected procedures pass (`anvilEnableTracesProcedure.spec.ts` and `anvilMineDetailedProcedure.spec.ts`).

## Analysis

- **Success:** True
- **Needs Continuation:** Yes, more issues remain to triage
