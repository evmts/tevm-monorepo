**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Duration:** ~10 minutes
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.5

## Summary

This session focused on triaging open issues, closing completed items, and updating tracking issues.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Closed Issue #1934 - Debug Tracers Complete
- **Issue:** "Implement missing debug tracers"
- **Action:** Verified all main tracers are implemented and closed the issue
- **Tracers implemented:**
  - ✅ Default tracer (opcode-level structLogs)
  - ✅ callTracer - Nested call tree structure
  - ✅ prestateTracer - Account state with diffMode option
  - ✅ 4byteTracer - Function selector frequencies
  - ✅ flatCallTracer - Parity/OpenEthereum-compatible flat trace format
  - ✅ muxTracer - Multiplexes multiple tracers
- **Note:** erc7562Tracer tracked separately in #1931

### 2. Updated Issue #1747 - Test Matchers
- **Issue:** "Feature: @tevm/test-matchers"
- **Action:** Added comment confirming contract matchers are fully implemented
- **Contract matchers verified working:**
  - ✅ toCallContractFunction - Detects function calls by name, signature, or selector
  - ✅ withFunctionArgs - Validates positional function arguments
  - ✅ withFunctionNamedArgs - Validates named function arguments (partial matching)
- **Tests:** 32 tests passing in `toCallContractFunction.spec.ts`

## Issue Status Review

| Issue | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| #1966 | EIP-7702 Support | Blocked - awaiting Guillotine migration |
| #1946 | eth_simulateV2 | V1 implemented, V2 needs clarification |
| #1941 | test-node passthrough | Feature request - needs implementation |
| #1934 | Debug tracers | **CLOSED** - all main tracers done |
| #1931 | erc7562Tracer | Feature request - specialized AA tracer |
| #1747 | test-matchers | **UPDATED** - contract matchers complete |
| #1595 | Fork chain ID | Has draft PR #1994 (needs work) |
| #1591 | Deno install hang | Known issue - workspace complexity |
| #1385 | Inline sol | Feature request |
| #1350 | Network import | Feature request |

## Issues Resolved This Session
- **#1934** - Closed (all main tracers implemented)

## Code Verified
- Contract matchers in `extensions/test-matchers/src/matchers/contract/`
- Tracer implementations in `packages/actions/src/debug/`

## Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Look at draft PR #1994 for issue #1595 (fork chain ID)
2. Consider implementing erc7562Tracer (#1931)
3. Address remaining test-matchers features (advanced tx/block matchers)
4. Consider Deno compatibility investigation

## Git Status
