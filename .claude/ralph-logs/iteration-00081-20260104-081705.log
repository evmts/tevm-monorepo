I've successfully completed this migration iteration. Here's a summary:

## Migration Iteration 126 Complete

**Migrated:** Native `Address` class implementation replacing `@ethereumjs/util` Address

**New files created:**
- `packages/utils/src/address.js` - Native Address class with full API compatibility
- `packages/utils/src/address.spec.ts` - 24 comprehensive tests

**Key changes:**
1. Implemented native `Address` class with methods:
   - `equals()`, `isZero()`, `isPrecompileOrSystemAddress()`
   - `toString()`, `toBytes()`
   
2. Added factory functions:
   - `createAddressFromString(str)` - Create from hex string
   - `createAddressFromBigInt(value)` - Create from bigint 
   - `createZeroAddress()` - Create zero address

3. Updated exports:
   - `Address` exported as `EthjsAddress` for backward compatibility
   - All factory functions exported

**Test results:** All 489 utils tests pass (1 skipped)

**Remaining @ethereumjs/util exports:**
- `EthjsAccount` and `createAccount` - Account class
- EIP-7702 utilities - Authorization utilities
