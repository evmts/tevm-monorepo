## Summary

The voltaire/guillotine-mini migration is in excellent shape:

**Completed Migrations:**
- All crypto primitives (Keccak256, Secp256k1, EIP712, P256) use @tevm/voltaire
- Native implementations created for accounts, signatures, RLP, transaction serialization
- Core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node) have no viem crypto imports

**Tests Verified:**
- 102/102 core crypto tests passing

**Remaining (intentional):**
- viem transport functions for RPC/forking (required for external node communication)
- @ethereumjs/common for hardfork configuration (deep EVM integration)
- @scure/bip39/bip32 for HD wallets (blocked by voltaire FFI issue)

The migration has reached a stable state. No additional incremental changes are possible without:
1. Waiting for voltaire HDWallet FFI fix
2. Major architectural changes for @ethereumjs/common replacement
