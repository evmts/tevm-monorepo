Successfully completed iteration 118. Here's the summary:

## Migration Iteration 118 Complete

**Migrated:** 5 Ethereum constants from `@ethereumjs/util` to native implementations

### Constants migrated:
- `GWEI_TO_WEI` (1000000000n)
- `BIGINT_0` (0n)
- `BIGINT_1` (1n)  
- `MAX_UINT64` (2^64 - 1)
- `SECP256K1_ORDER_DIV_2` (half of secp256k1 curve order)

### Files changed:
- **New:** `packages/utils/src/constants.js` - Native constant implementations
- **New:** `packages/utils/src/constants.spec.ts` - Test file (100% coverage)
- **Modified:** `packages/utils/src/ethereumjs.js` - Removed 5 constants from exports
- **Modified:** `packages/utils/src/index.ts` - Added exports from constants.js

### Test results:
- All 385 tests pass in @tevm/utils
- `constants.js` has 100% test coverage

The codebase now has 5 fewer dependencies on `@ethereumjs/util`. These trivial constants were easy wins that continue the incremental migration progress.
