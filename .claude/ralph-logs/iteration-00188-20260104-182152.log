## Summary

Successfully completed Iteration 241 of the migration. Key achievements:

### guillotine-mini WASM Build Fixed
1. **Updated dependency** - Changed from remote GitHub URL (which had hash mismatch issues) to local voltaire path
2. **Fixed WASI compatibility** - Added WASI target support in voltaire's bn254.zig and a dummy `main()` function in root_c.zig
3. **Built Rust crypto wrappers** - Compiled arkworks BN254/BLS12-381 for wasm32-wasip1 target
4. **WASM size: 446KB** - Includes full EVM, crypto primitives, and precompiles

### guillotineWasm.js Integration
1. **Added WASI shims** - Complete wasi_snapshot_preview1 import stubs
2. **Fixed BigInt conversions** - WASM i64/u64 parameters now correctly use BigInt
3. **Fixed boolean conversion** - evm_execute return value properly converts to JS boolean

### Test Results
All 18 tests pass:
- Utility functions (hexToAddress, u256ToBytes, bytesToU256)
- WASM state management  
- WASM loading and EVM instance creation
- Basic bytecode execution

The guillotine-mini WASM module is now buildable and testable. This is a significant milestone for the migration - we now have a working Zig EVM compiled to WASM that can be used as an optional accelerator in tevm.
