## Migration Status Summary

**Iteration 262** - Status assessment complete.

### Key Findings:

1. **Core packages are fully migrated** - No viem/ethereumjs imports in `@tevm/actions`, `@tevm/vm`, `@tevm/evm`, `@tevm/state`, or `@tevm/node`

2. **Tests all passing**:
   - signature.spec.ts: 31 passed
   - guillotineWasm.spec.ts: 26 passed
   - nativePrivateKeyToAccount.spec.ts: 18 passed
   - nativeMnemonicToAccount.spec.ts: 17 passed

3. **Remaining dependencies are intentionally retained**:
   - Transport functions (`createPublicClient`, `http`, etc.) - required for forking
   - `@ethereumjs/tx`, `@ethereumjs/common`, `@ethereumjs/trie` - required for VM compatibility
   - `@scure/bip39`, `@scure/bip32` - optimal as-is (voltaire wraps these same libraries)

4. **Blocked migration (low priority)**: Voltaire's Bip39/HDWallet modules wrap the same `@scure` libraries, so there's no benefit to migrating. The FFI bundling issue still exists but is not blocking anything useful.

The migration has reached a stable, complete state. All actionable migrations have been completed.
