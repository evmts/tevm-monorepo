All my changes are working correctly. The key accomplishments for this iteration:

1. **Fixed formatAbi type preservation** - Re-exported from abitype to maintain type-level transformations
2. **Fixed state package type incompatibilities** - Added proper casts between `AddressInterface`/`AccountInterface` and their concrete class implementations
3. **Added missing type exports** - `AccountData` and `AccountInterface` to `@tevm/utils`
4. **Fixed AccountInterface** - Added `isContract()` method and fixed `codeSize` to allow undefined
5. **Fixed EVM type issues** - Added `customPrecompiles` to `EVMOpts`
6. **Fixed several precompiles type issues** - Various fixes for branded types and handler types

The remaining type errors in `@tevm/precompiles` and `@tevm/vm` are related to `ExecResult` type compatibility issues that will need more investigation in the next iteration.
