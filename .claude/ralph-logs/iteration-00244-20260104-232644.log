The migration assessment is complete. Here's the summary:

## Migration Status Summary

**Core packages are now free of direct viem/ethereumjs runtime imports:**
- @tevm/actions, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/vm, @tevm/node - all clean

**Remaining ethereumjs dependencies** (3 packages):
1. **@tevm/common** - Uses @ethereumjs/common (needed for ethereumjs EVM integration)
2. **@tevm/tx** - Re-exports @ethereumjs/tx classes (used by ethereumjs EVM)
3. **@tevm/trie** - Re-exports @ethereumjs/trie

**Why they remain:** The ethereumjs EVM expects ethereumjs Common and Transaction class instances. Migrating these would require either adapting voltaire types to match ethereumjs interfaces or replacing the ethereumjs EVM entirely with guillotine-mini.

**Tests passing:** 655 utils tests, 55 evm tests

**Next steps for deeper migration:**
1. Continue expanding guillotine-mini WASM integration
2. Once guillotine-mini can fully replace ethereumjs EVM, migrate @tevm/common and @tevm/tx to use voltaire primitives
