# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 721
## Date: 2026-01-05

## Task: Add tests for native cache implementations

## Changes Made
1. Created `packages/utils/src/AccountCache.spec.ts` with 24 tests
2. Created `packages/utils/src/StorageCache.spec.ts` with 28 tests

## Test Coverage
### AccountCache tests cover:
- Basic operations (put, get, delete, clear, size)
- Checkpoint/revert/commit functionality
- Nested checkpoints
- Flush operation
- Stats tracking
- Both LRU and ORDERED_MAP cache types
- Storing undefined accounts

### StorageCache tests cover:
- Basic operations (put, get, delete, clearStorage, clear, size)
- Checkpoint/revert/commit functionality
- Nested checkpoints
- Flush operation
- Stats tracking
- Dump operation
- Both LRU and ORDERED_MAP cache types

## Test Results
- AccountCache: 24 tests passing
- StorageCache: 28 tests passing
- Total new tests: 52

## Notes
- Fixed import to use `createAddressFromString` instead of `createAddress`
- Both cache implementations use bytesToUnprefixedHex for address/key conversion
- Cache implementations are migrated from @ethereumjs/statemanager
