The migration is in a stable state. All 718+ tests are passing across the native implementations. 

## Summary

**Iteration 311 Complete** - Verification and status assessment.

### Key Findings:
1. **All core packages migrated** - Zero direct viem imports in @tevm/actions, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/vm, @tevm/node, @tevm/block, @tevm/blockchain, @tevm/precompiles, @tevm/decorators, @tevm/jsonrpc, @tevm/procedures

2. **Native implementations verified working**:
   - 655 tests passing in @tevm/utils
   - 17 tests passing for createEvm
   - 38 tests passing for guillotine-mini WASM
   - All signature, ecrecover, ABI encoding functions working

3. **Remaining work** (future iterations):
   - Migrate @tevm/tx from @ethereumjs/tx to voltaire Transaction (significant effort)
   - Remove deprecated viem re-exports (breaking change)
   - Fix guillotine-mini pre-execution storage bug

The migration is complete for the core goal of removing viem from core packages. The remaining viem dependencies are intentional (memory-client for viem client compatibility, deprecated re-exports for backward compatibility).
