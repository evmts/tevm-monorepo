# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 377
## Date: 2026-01-05 03:23

## Summary
Migrated 3 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **songbirdTestnet.js** (id: 16) - Songbird Testnet Coston (Flare's canary testnet) with CFLR native currency, explorer API support
2. **sophonTestnet.js** (id: 531050104) - Sophon Testnet with SOPH native currency, WebSocket support, multicall3 contract at 0x83c04d112adedA2C6D9037bb6ecb42E7f0b108Af
3. **spicy.js** (id: 88882) - Chiliz Spicy Testnet with CHZ native currency, multiple RPC endpoints including publicnode.com fallback, WebSocket support

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Previously migrated**: ~297 (from iteration 376)
- **Migrated this session**: 3
- **Total migrated**: ~300
- **Remaining**: 44 (~13% remaining, excluding generator script)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- Sophon is a ZK-Sync based chain (has custom formatters in viem) but we only need basic chain info
- Spicy (Chiliz testnet) has good RPC redundancy with publicnode.com fallbacks
- Songbird Testnet is "Coston" network, separate from Songbird mainnet

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets (storyTestnet, stratis, syscoin, etc.).
44 files remain (~13% remaining).
