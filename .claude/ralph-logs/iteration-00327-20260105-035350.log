## Migration Status Summary (Iteration 387)

**Completed Tasks:**
1. Verified all core packages are migrated from direct viem/ethereumjs imports
2. All core tests pass (excluding network tests that require RPC env vars)
3. Updated @tevm/jsonrpc to export `nativeHttp` and `nativeWebSocket` alongside deprecated `http` and `webSocket`

**Core Packages Migrated:**
- @tevm/actions ✅
- @tevm/vm ✅  
- @tevm/evm ✅
- @tevm/state ✅
- @tevm/node ✅
- @tevm/block ✅
- @tevm/blockchain ✅

**Remaining (Intentional):**
- @tevm/memory-client - Viem client wrapper by design
- @tevm/utils/src/viem.js - Re-exports with native alternatives available
- @tevm/jsonrpc - Now has both deprecated and native exports
- Wrapper packages (@tevm/common, @tevm/tx, @tevm/trie) - Intentionally wrap ethereumjs
