# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 375
## Date: 2026-01-05 03:18

## Summary
Migrated 3 SKALE chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain, completing all SKALE chain migrations.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **skaleRazor.js** (id: 278611351) - SKALE Razor Network with sFUEL native currency, WebSocket support, no contracts
2. **skaleTitan.js** (id: 1350216234) - SKALE Titan Community Hub with sFUEL native currency, multicall3 contract, WebSocket support
3. **skaleTitanTestnet.js** (id: 1020352220) - SKALE Titan Hub testnet with sFUEL native currency, multicall3 contract, WebSocket support, testnet: true

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Previously migrated**: ~291 (from iteration 374)
- **Migrated this session**: 3
- **Total migrated**: ~294
- **Remaining**: 50 (~15% remaining, excluding generator script)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- All SKALE chains now fully migrated to nativeDefineChain
- All SKALE chains use sFUEL as their native currency (gas token, free to use)
- SKALE Titan (mainnet and testnet) have multicall3 deployed
- SKALE Razor has no contracts defined

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets (songbird, soneiumMinato, etc.).
50 files remain (~15% remaining).
