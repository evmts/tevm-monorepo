Migration iteration 25 completed successfully.

## Summary

**Changed:** `ethGetLogsHandler.js` now imports `InternalRpcError` from `@tevm/errors` instead of directly from `viem`.

**Commit:** `fb2370539`

**Remaining viem imports in @tevm/actions production code:**
- `contractHandler.js`: `getContractError`, `RawContractError` - These are complex viem utilities for decoding contract revert errors. Migrating these would require significant effort.

**Status:**
- Build succeeds
- Test failures are pre-existing issues with storageRoot validation (unrelated to this change)
- The @tevm/actions package now has only 1 file with direct viem runtime imports (down from 2)
