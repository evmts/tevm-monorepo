## Iteration 167 Summary

This was an **assessment iteration** to identify the next migration target after the @tevm/common native types work in iterations 165-166.

### Key Findings:

1. **Core packages are already clean** - @tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, and @tevm/node have no direct viem or ethereumjs imports in their source files.

2. **Chain preset migration blocked** - The 200+ chain presets in @tevm/common use `viem/chains`, but `@tevm/chains` (generated from DefiLlama) lacks Ethereum mainnet and other major chains, making migration impossible.

3. **Remaining ethereumjs dependencies**:
   - `@ethereumjs/common`: Still needed for `createCustomCommon` and `Mainnet` hardfork configs
   - `@ethereumjs/tx`: Used in packages/tx
   - `@ethereumjs/blockchain`: Used in packages/blockchain
   - `@ethereumjs/trie`: Used in packages/trie

4. **Viem dependency intentional** - The `viem/chains` Chain type is deeply integrated and provides compatibility with the viem ecosystem. The `@tevm/chains` package would need significant enhancement to replace it.

### Next Steps:
- Consider enhancing `@tevm/chains` to include major chains (mainnet, optimism, arbitrum)
- Or document viem dependency as intentional for ecosystem compatibility
- Future iterations could focus on `@ethereumjs/tx` migration
