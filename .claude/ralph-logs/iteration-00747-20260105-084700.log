# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 747
## Date: 2026-01-05

## Task: Migrate toBeRevertedWithString.spec.ts from viem/actions to client methods

## Summary

Successfully migrated extensions/test-matchers/src/matchers/errors/toBeRevertedWithString.spec.ts to use client methods directly instead of importing from viem/actions.

## File Modified

### extensions/test-matchers/src/matchers/errors/toBeRevertedWithString.spec.ts

**Removed:**
```typescript
import { writeContract } from 'viem/actions'
```

**Changed all function calls from:**
- `writeContract(client, {...})` → `client.writeContract({...})`

## Changes Made

1. Line 5: Removed viem/actions import
2. All 18 instances of `writeContract(client, ...)` → `client.writeContract(...)`

## Test Results

Tests fail due to pre-existing gas limit infrastructure issue (not related to this migration):
```
InternalError: tx gas limit 94952 is lower than the minimum gas limit of 190466
```

This is the same issue noted in iterations 745-746 and is not caused by the migration.

## Migration Progress

Remaining viem imports in test-matchers spec files:
- toBeRevertedWithError.spec.ts - has `writeContract` from viem/actions
