Good progress! The remaining `@ethereumjs/common` imports are:

1. `Common.ts` - imports the `Common` type (this is needed because our Common wraps the ethereumjs Common)
2. `createCommon.js` - imports `createCustomCommon` and `Mainnet` (core functionality that needs the ethereumjs implementation)
3. `createCommon.js` - type assertion for the boundary with ethereumjs (necessary while we still use ethereumjs internally)

This is expected - we're incrementally reducing the surface area but can't fully remove ethereumjs yet.

## Summary

In this iteration (166), I:

1. **Migrated `CommonOptions.ts`** to use the native `CustomCrypto` type from `./CustomCrypto.js` instead of `@ethereumjs/common`

2. **Updated `index.ts` exports** to:
   - Export `CustomCrypto`, `KZG`, and `VerkleCrypto` directly from the native file
   - Remove the `@ethereumjs/common` re-export
   - Remove the `NativeCustomCrypto` and `NativeKZG` aliases (they're no longer needed)

3. **Updated `createCommon.js`** to add a type assertion comment explaining the cast through `unknown` is needed because our native CustomCrypto interface is more flexible than ethereumjs's strict interface

The public API of `@tevm/common` now uses the native `CustomCrypto` type, reducing the dependency surface on `@ethereumjs/common` while maintaining full backward compatibility.
