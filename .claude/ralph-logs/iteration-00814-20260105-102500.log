## Task: Improve test coverage for signature.js

## Summary

Added tests to improve coverage of signature.js, specifically targeting:
- Non-string address values (pass-through) at line 240
- Uint8Array bytes values (pass-through) at lines 248-249
- Dynamic array type handling at lines 224-226
- Address array handling

## Changes Made

### Modified files:
- `packages/utils/src/signature.spec.ts` - Added 6 new tests (1 skipped)

### Test additions:
1. `should handle address values that are not strings (pass-through)` - Tests non-string address
2. `should handle bytes values as Uint8Array (pass-through)` - Tests Uint8Array bytes
3. `should handle bytes32 values as Uint8Array (pass-through)` - Tests Uint8Array bytes32
4. `should handle dynamic array types (e.g., uint256[])` - Tests dynamic arrays
5. `should handle fixed-size array types` - SKIPPED: voltaire doesn't support this
6. `should handle address array types` - Tests address[]

## Coverage Improvement

- signature.js: 97.6% → 99.28% (statement)
- signature.js: 86.66% → 94.33% (branch)
- signature.js: 100% → 100% (function)
- signature.js: 97.6% → 99.28% (line)

## Remaining uncovered:
- Lines 231-233: Fixed-size array handling - voltaire doesn't support this yet

## Status: COMPLETE
