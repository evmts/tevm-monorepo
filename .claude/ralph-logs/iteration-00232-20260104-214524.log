## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive status assessment for the voltaire migration. Here's the current state:

**Migration Complete:**
- All core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node, @tevm/block, @tevm/jsonrpc, @tevm/precompiles) are now viem-free
- Native implementations exist for all account functions (nativePrivateKeyToAccount, nativeMnemonicToAccount, nativeHdAccount)
- Cryptographic operations use @tevm/voltaire (Secp256k1, Keccak256, P256, etc.)
- Guillotine WASM EVM is integrated

**Remaining viem dependencies in @tevm/utils (intentionally kept):**
1. Transport functions (`createPublicClient`, `http`, `webSocket`, etc.) - Required for fork client RPC communication
2. Deprecated account exports - Native replacements exist, removal would be breaking change

**Test status:**
- Core tests pass (utils: 253 tests, evm: 55 tests, block: 2 tests)
- Fork-related tests fail due to missing environment variables (expected)

**Next potential migrations:**
1. Transport layer migration (viem -> voltaire providers)
2. Remove deprecated viem account exports (breaking change)
3. @ethereumjs/tx replacement (large scope)

The migration has achieved its primary goal of removing viem/ethereumjs from cryptographic operations in the execution path.
