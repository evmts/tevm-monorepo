## Summary

I successfully completed **Iteration 156** of the Ralph migration:

### What was done:
1. **Migrated `@tevm/rlp`** from `@ethereumjs/rlp` to `@tevm/voltaire/Rlp`
2. Created a compatibility wrapper in `packages/rlp/src/Rlp.ts` that:
   - Provides the same API as @ethereumjs/rlp (`Rlp.encode()` and `Rlp.decode()`)
   - Uses voltaire's RLP implementation internally via subpath import
   - Handles type conversions between voltaire's branded types and raw values
   - Maintains backward compatibility with empty input handling

3. Updated `packages/rlp/package.json` to:
   - Remove `@ethereumjs/rlp` dependency
   - Add `@tevm/voltaire` workspace dependency

### Test Results:
- RLP package test passes
- Block package (uses RLP): 2 tests passed
- Receipt-manager (heavy RLP usage): 34 tests passed

### Key Technical Details:
- Used `@tevm/voltaire/Rlp` subpath import to avoid native FFI module loading issues
- Voltaire's decode returns `{ data: BrandedRlp, remainder }` while ethereumjs returns raw values directly
- The wrapper uses `VoltaireRlp.toRaw()` to convert branded types back to `Uint8Array | NestedUint8Array`
