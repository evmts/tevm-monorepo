Migration iteration complete. 

**Summary:**
- Migrated `packages/memory-client/src/test/viem/getTransactionConfirmations.spec.ts`
- Changed `import type { Hex } from 'viem'` to `import type { Hex } from '@tevm/utils'`
- Type check passed
- Committed as `c339b12d7`

The test failure is a pre-existing issue in the state module unrelated to this migration (same issue noted in previous iteration logs).
