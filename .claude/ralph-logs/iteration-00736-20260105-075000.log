# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 736
## Date: 2026-01-05

## Task: Migrate http import to nativeHttp in test file

## Summary

Successfully migrated one test file from using deprecated viem `http` transport to native `nativeHttp` implementation.

## Changes Made

### packages/state/src/actions/getForkClient.spec.ts
- Changed `import { http } from '@tevm/utils'` to `import { nativeHttp } from '@tevm/utils'`
- Changed `http('https://example.com')` to `nativeHttp('https://example.com')`

## Test Results

All 3 tests pass:
- ✓ should return a fork client with transport function
- ✓ should return a fork client with transport object
- ✓ should error if no fork config

## Impact

- Removed 1 usage of deprecated viem re-export
- Uses native @tevm/voltaire-based http transport implementation
- No external viem dependency for this transport

## Files Not Migrated

### packages/http-client/src/createHttpClient.js
- This file is already marked as @deprecated
- Uses both `createPublicClient` and `http` from viem
- `createPublicClient` doesn't have a native equivalent in @tevm/utils yet
- Recommend leaving as-is since the whole file is deprecated

## Notes

The `nativeHttp` function is a drop-in replacement for viem's `http` transport that uses `@tevm/voltaire/provider`'s HttpProvider internally. It provides the same API but without the viem dependency.
