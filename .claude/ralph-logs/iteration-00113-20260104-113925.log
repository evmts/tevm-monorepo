I've successfully completed iteration 163 of the Ralph migration. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Migration Summary

### Created Native Cache Implementations
1. **StorageCache** (`packages/utils/src/StorageCache.js`) - Native implementation with:
   - LRU and ORDERED_MAP cache type support
   - Checkpoint/revert/commit functionality
   - Diff cache for tracking changes

2. **AccountCache** (`packages/utils/src/AccountCache.js`) - Native implementation with:
   - Same features as StorageCache
   - Account-specific RLP serialization support

### Removed @ethereumjs/statemanager Dependency
- Removed from `@tevm/state` package.json
- Updated all imports across 18 files
- Fixed compatibility issues:
  - `ContractCache.has()` - updated to use native Map's `.get()` instead of OrderedMap's `.getElementByKey()`
  - `getAccountAddresses.js` - updated to use native Map's `.forEach((value, key))` signature

### Test Results
- All 109 non-RPC tests pass
- Build completes successfully without @ethereumjs/statemanager imports in dist

### Impact
- Eliminated `@ethereumjs/statemanager` dependency from `@tevm/state`
- Reduces bundle size by removing `@js-sdsl/ordered-map` transitive dependency
- Added `lru-cache` as a direct dependency of `@tevm/utils`
