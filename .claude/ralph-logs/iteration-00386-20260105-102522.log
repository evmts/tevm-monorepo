I've completed iteration 815. Here's a summary:

**Iteration 815 - Add test coverage for trim function in viem.js**

Added 15 comprehensive tests for the `trim` function in `viem.js`, which was previously untested. The tests cover:
- Hex string trimming (left and right directions)
- Uint8Array trimming (left and right directions)
- Edge cases like all-zero values and single bytes

**Coverage improvement:**
- viem.js: 88.04% → 90.53% statement coverage
- Overall utils: 95.76% → 96.46% statement coverage

The uncovered lines in viem.js that remain are lines 1416 and 1437-1457 which are in other functions. The overall utils package still needs more coverage to reach 100%.
