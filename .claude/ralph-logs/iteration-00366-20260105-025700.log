# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 366
## Date: 2026-01-05 02:57

## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **polygonZkEvm.js** (id: 1101) - Polygon zkEVM mainnet with ETH native currency, multicall3 contract
2. **polygonZkEvmCardona.js** (id: 2442) - Polygon zkEVM Cardona testnet with ETH native currency, multicall3 contract, apiUrl in block explorer
3. **polygonZkEvmTestnet.js** (id: 1442) - Polygon zkEVM Testnet with ETH native currency, multicall3 contract, dual block explorers (Blockscout + PolygonScan)
4. **pulsechain.js** (id: 369) - PulseChain mainnet with PLS native currency, WebSocket support, ensRegistry + multicall3 contracts
5. **pulsechainV4.js** (id: 943) - PulseChain V4 testnet with v4PLS native currency, WebSocket support, ensRegistry + multicall3 contracts

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Previously migrated**: ~246 (from iteration 365)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~251
- **Remaining**: 93 (~27% remaining, excluding generator script)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- PulseChain chains use their own native token (PLS/v4PLS) rather than ETH
- PulseChain has ensRegistry support
- polygonZkEvmTestnet has two block explorers (blockscout and default PolygonScan)

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. 93 remain (~27% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: qMainnet, qTestnet, real, redbellyTestnet, redstone...
