## Migration Complete - Iteration 124

Successfully migrated `fetchFromProvider` and `getProvider` from `@ethereumjs/util` to native implementations:

**New files:**
- `packages/utils/src/provider.js` - Native implementations
- `packages/utils/src/provider.spec.ts` - 11 tests (all passing, 100% coverage)

**Changes:**
- Updated `ethereumjs.js` to mark these as migrated
- Updated `index.ts` to export from native `provider.js`

**Test results:** 448 passed, 1 skipped

**Remaining @ethereumjs/util exports:**
- `EthjsAccount`, `EthjsAddress` (core classes)
- `createAccount`, `createAddressFromString` (factory functions)
- `createWithdrawal`, `Withdrawal` (withdrawal handling)
- EIP-7702 utilities (authorization functions)
