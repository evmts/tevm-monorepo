Good - the changes remain in the working directory but are not staged. The export additions (`setStorage`, `getStorage`) I made to packages/evm/src/index.ts are part of the larger in-progress migration.

## Summary

In this iteration (299), I:

1. **Reviewed migration status**: Confirmed that all core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/vm, @tevm/node) are now free of direct viem/ethereumjs imports

2. **Added missing exports**: Added `setStorage` and `getStorage` functions to the @tevm/evm public API. These guillotine WASM functions were implemented but not exported from the package index.

3. **Verified tests pass**: 
   - 655 utils tests passing
   - 55 evm tests passing
   - 17 decorators tests passing
   - Build types succeed

4. **Documented the iteration**: Created iteration log at `.claude/ralph-logs/iteration-00299-20260104-233400.log`

The migration is in a stable state with:
- Core packages fully migrated to use @tevm/voltaire
- Guillotine WASM integration complete with all functions exported
- Remaining ethereumjs dependencies are architectural (for EVM compatibility)
- User-facing packages (memory-client) intentionally keep viem for API compatibility
