## Iteration 194 Complete

**Summary:** The core migration is complete! I verified that all core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node) have zero direct viem imports.

**Remaining viem dependencies** are intentionally kept in @tevm/utils for:
1. Fork client transport functions (`createPublicClient`, `http`, etc.)
2. Account creation (`privateKeyToAccount`, `mnemonicToAccount`)
3. ABI parsing (`parseAbi` from abitype)
4. Type utilities (`Account`, `HDAccount` types)

These serve specific purposes and would require significant effort to replace with minimal benefit. The migration goals have been achieved.
