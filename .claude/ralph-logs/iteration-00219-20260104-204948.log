## Summary

In this iteration, I:

1. **Assessed migration status**: Core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node) are already viem-free. Remaining viem usage is intentional (transport for forking) or deprecated backward-compatible exports.

2. **Attempted voltaire Bip39/HDWallet migration**: Tried to migrate `nativeMnemonicToAccount.js` from @scure/bip39 and @scure/bip32 to voltaire's wrappers, but this was blocked by FFI dependency issues (ref-napi/ffi-napi fail to load in the test environment).

3. **Successfully migrated privateKeyToAddress.js**: Replaced `hexToBytes` import from `viem.js` with voltaire's `Hex.toBytes`, reducing internal viem dependencies by one more import.

**Changes made:**
- `packages/utils/src/privateKeyToAddress.js`: Now uses `Hex` from `@tevm/voltaire/Hex` instead of `hexToBytes` from `./viem.js`

**Tests passing:**
- nativePrivateKeyToAccount.spec.ts: 18/18 passed
- signature.spec.ts: 31/31 passed
- Build types: SUCCESS
