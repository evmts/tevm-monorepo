# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 808

## Task: Improve test coverage for abiEventEncoding.js

## Summary

Added tests to improve coverage of abiEventEncoding.js, specifically targeting:
- Non-strict mode handling when no events in ABI (line 70)
- Non-strict mode handling when no matching event for topic0 (line 118)
- Array type value handling in decoded event data

## Changes Made

### Modified files:
- `packages/utils/src/abiEventEncoding.spec.ts` - Added 3 new tests

### Test additions:
1. `returns undefined for no events in ABI in non-strict mode` - Tests empty ABI case
2. `returns undefined when no matching event for topic0 in non-strict mode` - Tests mismatched selector case
3. `handles event with uint256 array in data` - Tests array type event decoding

## Coverage Improvement

- abiEventEncoding.js: 90.15% → 93.26%
- Branch coverage: 77.77% → 80.48%
- Overall coverage: 95.46% → 95.54%

## Remaining uncovered lines in abiEventEncoding.js:
- Lines 135-136: Address type Uint8Array to hex conversion in decoded values
- Lines 141-142: Pass-through for Uint8Array values that are not address/bytes types

These lines handle edge cases where voltaire returns Uint8Array for certain types.
The current implementation may not hit these branches because voltaire returns
native types directly in most cases.

## Status: COMPLETE
