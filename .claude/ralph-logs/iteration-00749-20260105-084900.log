# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 749
## Date: 2026-01-05

## Task: Attempted migration of tevmMine.spec.ts from viem/actions

## Summary

Attempted to migrate packages/memory-client/src/tevmMine.spec.ts from viem/actions to client methods, but **reverted** because this file uses `createClient` (raw viem client) not `createMemoryClient` (with all actions attached).

## Analysis

The file creates a client using:
```typescript
client = createClient({
  transport: createTevmTransport(),
})
```

This is a basic viem `Client` type without the public/wallet/test actions attached. The pattern of importing from `viem/actions` and calling `getBlock(client)` is actually the correct way to use actions with basic clients.

## Decision

**No migration possible** for files using basic `createClient`. The viem/actions imports are the appropriate pattern for these tests.

Files that CAN be migrated:
- Files using `createMemoryClient` which extends the client with all actions

Files that CANNOT be easily migrated without refactoring:
- Files using basic `createClient` from viem (these must use `action(client)` pattern)

## Next Steps

Look for files using `createMemoryClient` pattern which are migratable.
