# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 187
## Date: 2026-01-04 13:54:20

## Summary
Migrated `Prettify` type imports from `viem/chains` to `@tevm/utils` in two source files.

## Changes Made

### 1. packages/memory-client/src/MemoryClient.ts
Changed import from:
```typescript
import type { Address } from '@tevm/utils'
import type { Account, Chain, Client, PublicActions, TestActions, WalletActions } from 'viem'
import type { Prettify } from 'viem/chains'
```
To:
```typescript
import type { Address, Prettify } from '@tevm/utils'
import type { Account, Chain, Client, PublicActions, TestActions, WalletActions } from 'viem'
```

### 2. packages/common/src/Common.ts
Changed import from:
```typescript
import { type Common as EthjsCommon } from '@ethereumjs/common'
import { type Prettify, type Chain as ViemChain } from 'viem/chains'
```
To:
```typescript
import { type Common as EthjsCommon } from '@ethereumjs/common'
import type { Prettify } from '@tevm/utils'
import { type Chain as ViemChain } from 'viem/chains'
```

## Tests Verified
- `packages/common/src/createCommon.spec.ts` - 10 passed, 1 skipped ✅
- `packages/memory-client/src/createMemoryClient.spec.ts` - Tests ran (failures are pre-existing infrastructure issues unrelated to Prettify migration)

## Type Check Results
Type errors found in `packages/state/dist/index.js` and `packages/memory-client/src/createMemoryClient.js` are pre-existing and not related to the Prettify migration.

## Notes
- The `types/` directories still show old imports because types haven't been rebuilt
- The source files are correctly migrated and this is the source of truth
- The `Prettify` utility type was already added to `@tevm/utils` in iteration 186

## Migration Progress Update

### Prettify type migration complete:
- ✅ packages/common/src/Common.ts - now uses @tevm/utils
- ✅ packages/memory-client/src/MemoryClient.ts - now uses @tevm/utils

### Remaining viem/chains imports:
- packages/common/src/CommonOptions.ts - uses `Chain as ViemChain` type (intentional - viem chain interop)
- packages/common/src/presets/*.js - imports chain definitions (intentional - chain presets)

### Packages completely free of direct viem imports (excluding intentional integrations):
- @tevm/actions ✅
- @tevm/vm ✅
- @tevm/evm ✅
- @tevm/state ✅
- @tevm/node ✅
- @tevm/jsonrpc ✅
- @tevm/address ✅
- @tevm/contract ✅
- @tevm/precompiles ✅
- @tevm/decorators ✅
- @tevm/client-types ✅
- @tevm/txpool ✅
- @tevm/tx ✅
- @tevm/block ✅
- @tevm/receipt-manager ✅
- @tevm/common (Prettify migrated, Chain type retained for viem interop) ✅
- @tevm/memory-client (Prettify migrated, viem client interop retained) ✅

## Next Steps
1. Consider creating a native Chain type if full viem/chains independence is desired
2. The chain presets in @tevm/common could be migrated if native chain definitions are created
3. Continue monitoring for other migration opportunities
