5. **skaleEuropa.js** (id: 2046399126) - SKALE Europa Liquidity Hub mainnet with sFUEL native currency, multicall3 contract, WebSocket support

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Previously migrated**: ~281 (from iteration 372)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~286
- **Remaining**: 58 (~17% remaining, excluding generator script)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- All SKALE chains use sFUEL as their native currency (gas token)
- All SKALE chains have WebSocket RPC support in addition to HTTP
- SKALE is a multi-chain network focused on gaming and DeFi
- Most SKALE chains have multicall3 deployed

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining SKALE chain presets. 58 remain (~17% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: skaleEuropaTestnet, skaleExorde, skaleHumanProtocol, skaleNebula, skaleNebulaTestnet...
