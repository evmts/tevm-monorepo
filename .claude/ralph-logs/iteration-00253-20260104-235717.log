## Iteration 307 Complete

**Summary**: Verification iteration confirming migration stability.

**Key Findings**:
- All core packages remain clean of viem/ethereumjs imports
- Recently changed files (last 10 commits) maintain migration patterns
- No new viem imports detected in core packages
- @tevm/utils test suite: **655 tests passed** (1 skipped)

**Migration Status**: Core package migration is **COMPLETE** and **STABLE**

The remaining viem usage in `@tevm/memory-client` is intentional for user-facing API compatibility. The ethereumjs dependencies (`@ethereumjs/common`, `@ethereumjs/tx`, `@ethereumjs/trie`) are architectural and documented.

**Future Opportunities**:
- Voltaire has comprehensive Transaction primitives that could potentially replace `@ethereumjs/tx`
- Block primitives available in voltaire for potential `@tevm/block` migration
