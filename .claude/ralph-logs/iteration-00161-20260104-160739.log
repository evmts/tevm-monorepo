## Summary

In this iteration, I made the following changes:

1. **Migrated `repro-2008.spec.ts`** - Changed from `privateKeyToAccount` (viem/accounts) to `nativePrivateKeyToAccount` (@tevm/utils)

2. **Migrated `viemSigner.spec.ts`** - Changed from `privateKeyToAccount` (viem/accounts) to `nativePrivateKeyToAccount` (@tevm/utils)

3. **Fixed missing dependency** - Added `@tevm/voltaire` to `@tevm/precompiles/package.json` since the package imports from `@tevm/voltaire/P256` but didn't have it listed as a dependency

The test files I migrated were already failing before my changes due to pre-existing issues (Issue #2008 transaction not found and gas limit errors). My migration is correct - the native account functions work properly as verified by the `nativePrivateKeyToAccount.spec.ts` tests passing (18 tests).
