## Iteration 263 Summary

**Status**: Verification complete - migration is stable.

**Tests Run**:
- signature.spec.ts: 31 passed
- guillotineWasm.spec.ts: 26 passed (1 skipped)
- nativePrivateKeyToAccount.spec.ts: 18 passed
- nativeMnemonicToAccount.spec.ts: 17 passed
- Bloom.spec.ts: 6 passed
- eip7702.spec.ts: 22 passed
- prefundedAccounts.spec.ts: 1 passed

**Analysis**: Investigated potential migration of viem transport functions to voltaire's HttpProvider/WebSocketProvider. Determined this is **not actionable** because:
1. Voltaire's providers are raw EIP-1193 (just `request({ method, params })`)
2. Viem's PublicClient provides typed convenience methods (`getProof`, `getStorageAt`, etc.)
3. These typed methods are used throughout the state package's forking logic
4. Would require significant architectural changes with low benefit

**Conclusion**: The migration has reached its practical completion point. All low-hanging fruit has been harvested. Remaining viem dependencies are either:
- Architecturally required (transport layer for forking)
- Intentionally retained for backward compatibility
- Part of memory-client which is designed as a viem wrapper
