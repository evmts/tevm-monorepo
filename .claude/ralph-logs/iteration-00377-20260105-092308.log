## Summary

In this iteration, I attempted to migrate viem type imports from memory-client package to @tevm/utils but discovered this isn't feasible:

**Key Finding**: The memory-client package must keep viem type imports because:
1. `PublicActions`, `WalletActions`, `Client` etc. are generic types with complex type parameters in viem
2. @tevm/utils has simplified versions that don't support the full generic signature
3. memory-client is a user-facing API that must be fully viem-compatible

**Current Migration Status**:
- Core packages (actions, vm, evm, state, node) are already free of direct viem imports
- 8 @ethereumjs imports remain (common, trie, tx packages)
- memory-client and extensions/viem must keep viem imports by design

**Files changed**: None (all changes were reverted after discovering the incompatibility)
