## Summary

I attempted to migrate `encodeAbiParameters` and `decodeAbiParameters` from viem to native implementations using @tevm/voltaire. 

**Findings:**
- The core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node) are already free of direct viem imports
- @tevm/utils still has viem dependencies for:
  1. Account functions (mnemonicToAccount, privateKeyToAccount)
  2. ABI encoding/decoding functions
  3. Transport/client functions for forking

**Blocker:**
Voltaire has a build issue - the `src/jsonrpc/index.ts` file references `./types/index.js` which doesn't exist, preventing the package from building. This blocks the ABI migration.

**Status:**
- Created an implementation that would work once voltaire builds
- Reverted all changes since voltaire can't be used as a dependency currently
- All tests pass after revert
- Documented the blocker in the iteration log

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix voltaire's build issue (missing `./types/index.js` in jsonrpc module)
2. Once fixed, the ABI migration can proceed with the approach I prototyped
