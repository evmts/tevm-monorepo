The iteration is complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Iteration 232 Summary

**Change Made**: Removed unused `@noble/curves` dependency from `@tevm/precompiles` package.

**Why**: The p256verify precompile was migrated to use `@tevm/voltaire/P256` in a previous iteration, making the `@noble/curves` dependency unnecessary in the precompiles package.

**Test Results**:
- p256verify tests: 4/4 passed ✓
- ecrecover tests: 7/7 passed ✓  
- Core voltaire tests: 59/59 passed ✓
- Native account tests: 35/35 passed ✓

**File Modified**:
- `packages/precompiles/package.json` - removed `"@noble/curves": "^2.0.1"` from dependencies

**Pre-existing Issues Noted** (not related to this change):
- `definePrecompile.spec.ts` has 4 failing tests due to `EvmError is not a constructor` - this is an issue with how `@ethereumjs/evm` exports the EvmError class

**Migration Status**:
- Core packages (actions, vm, evm, state, node, block) have no direct viem imports
- Precompiles package now has no noble/curves dependency (uses voltaire/P256)
- Utils package still has noble/curves but legitimately uses it in tests for verification
