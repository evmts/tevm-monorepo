## Summary

I completed iteration 158 of the Ralph migration. The key fix was in `packages/state/src/utils/accountHelpers.js:18-54`.

### What was done:
1. **Identified the bug**: The `fromRlpSerializedAccount` function was passing raw `Uint8Array` values from RLP decoding for `nonce` and `balance` fields, but the `createAccount` function expects `bigint` values.

2. **Applied the fix**: Added a `bytesToBigInt` helper function and updated `fromRlpSerializedAccount` to properly convert RLP-decoded bytes to bigint.

3. **Results**: 
   - Before: 42 tests failing in @tevm/state
   - After: 32 tests failing (10 tests now passing)
   - All setStateRoot, saveStateRoot, getStateRoot, createBaseState, and ContractCache tests now pass

4. **Committed the change** with a descriptive commit message

### Remaining test failures are due to:
- Tests using short addresses like `'0x1'` (native Address implementation is stricter)
- Fork RPC tests failing due to missing environment variables
