## Iteration 224 Summary

The migration is in excellent shape. I verified that all core packages (`@tevm/actions`, `@tevm/vm`, `@tevm/evm`, `@tevm/state`, `@tevm/node`, `@tevm/block`) have zero viem imports in their source code.

**Key Findings:**
- Core packages fully migrated
- Bloom class uses voltaire's Keccak256 
- Signature functions use voltaire's EIP712 and native ecrecover
- All 607 utils tests passing
- Zero noble-curves imports remain in production code

**Remaining Dependencies (Intentional):**
- `memory-client` needs viem for compatibility layer (Client, PublicActions, etc.)
- `utils` exports viem transport functions for RPC communication
- ethereumjs packages needed for deep EVM integration (common, tx, statemanager)

No code changes were made this iteration - the migration is stable and progressing well.
