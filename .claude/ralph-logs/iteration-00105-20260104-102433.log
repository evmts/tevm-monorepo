Now let me summarize the changes and the current status:

## Iteration 154 Complete

I created native `Proof` and `StorageProof` types in `@tevm/utils` and migrated the state package to use them instead of importing from `@ethereumjs/statemanager`.

### Changes Made:
1. **Created** `packages/utils/src/proof-types.ts` - Native EIP-1186 proof types
2. **Updated** `packages/utils/src/index.ts` - Added exports for `Proof` and `StorageProof`
3. **Updated** `packages/state/src/StateManager.ts` - Uses native `Proof` type
4. **Updated** `packages/state/src/actions/getProof.js` - Updated JSDoc to reference native type

### Migration Status:
The core packages (actions, vm, evm, node) are now free of `@ethereumjs/statemanager` Proof imports. 

The remaining `@ethereumjs/statemanager` dependencies in the state package are:
- `AccountCache` class (5 files)
- `StorageCache` class (5 files)  
- `CacheType` enum (4 files)

These are complex implementations with LRU caching, ordered maps, and checkpoint/revert/commit functionality that would require substantial work to replace natively.
