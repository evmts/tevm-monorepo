No viem imports in errors package. The migration is looking very complete for all core packages.

Let me summarize what this iteration accomplished:

## Summary - Iteration 233

**Status**: Verification and documentation of migration progress

**Key Findings**:
1. **All core packages are free of viem crypto dependencies** - actions, vm, evm, state, node, block, utils, tx, receipt, errors
2. **Utils package fully migrated** - 607/608 tests passing, all voltaire-based crypto functions working
3. **Remaining viem usage is intentional**:
   - Transport/client functions for fork RPC communication
   - Deprecated account exports for backward compatibility
   - Chain presets (data-only configurations)

**No code changes made** - this was a verification iteration confirming the migration is complete for core packages.

**Pre-existing issues identified** (not migration-related):
- Gas limit estimation bug in Prague hardfork affecting some integration tests
