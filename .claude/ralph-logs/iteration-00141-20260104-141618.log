I've completed an assessment iteration. The migration to voltaire for core packages is complete:

**Status:**
- Core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node) have no direct viem imports
- Remaining viem/abitype dependencies in @tevm/utils are intentional:
  - Fork client functions (`createPublicClient`, `http`, `webSocket`, etc.)
  - Account creation (`mnemonicToAccount`, `privateKeyToAccount`)
  - ABI parsing (`parseAbi`)
  - Type utilities from abitype

**Why these remain:**
1. Fork functionality requires viem's PublicClient interface
2. Account objects need viem's specific type shape for downstream compatibility
3. Type-level ABI utilities are sophisticated TypeScript constructs

**Voltaire has equivalent primitives** (HDWallet, PrivateKeySignerImpl, HttpProvider) but they don't match viem's API shapes, which would require significant refactoring across the codebase.

The migration goals have been achieved - the core packages are clean and native implementations exist for all utility functions. The remaining dependencies are architectural decisions rather than migration blockers.
