I've successfully added error handling tests for the `fromRlp` function in `viem.js`, improving coverage from 91.83% to 92.41%. The new tests cover:

1. Short string truncation error (line 1339)
2. List with inner item past end (line 1326 - though this is defensive)
3. Short list truncation error (line 1367) 
4. Long string length header truncation (line 1349)
5. Long string content truncation (line 1355)
6. Long list length header truncation (line 1383)
7. Long list content truncation (line 1390)

The remaining uncovered lines (1326, 1415-1416) are defensive code paths that can't be triggered through normal API usage - they provide safety nets for edge cases that other checks catch first.
