Based on my investigation, the core packages are fully migrated from viem. The remaining viem imports are either:

1. **Intentional viem integrations** (memory-client, extensions/viem, utils re-exports)
2. **Blocked by type incompatibilities** requiring deeper changes to @tevm/utils types
3. **Blocked by runtime function dependencies** requiring native implementations

The key findings are:
- **Core package migration is complete** - packages/actions, vm, evm, state, node, block, blockchain, etc. have no viem imports
- **memory-client intentionally uses viem** - it's designed to provide viem-compatible API
- **Type mismatches exist** - Account's signTypedData and TransactionReceipt's status field have incompatible types between @tevm/utils and viem

To proceed further, we would need to:
1. Update the `Account` type in @tevm/utils to match viem's signTypedData generic signature
2. Add a processed `TransactionReceipt` type that uses `'success' | 'reverted'` status format
3. Implement native versions of viem/actions functions (getCode, estimateGas, getTransaction, getTransactionReceipt)
