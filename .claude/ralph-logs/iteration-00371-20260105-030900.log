## Date: 2026-01-05 03:09

## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **scrollSepolia.js** (id: 534351) - Scroll Sepolia testnet with ETH native currency, multicall3 contract, testnet flag
2. **sei.js** (id: 1329) - Sei Network mainnet with SEI native currency, WebSocket support, multicall3 contract
3. **seiDevnet.js** (id: 713715) - Sei Devnet with SEI native currency, testnet flag
4. **seiTestnet.js** (id: 1328) - Sei Testnet with SEI native currency, WebSocket support, testnet flag
5. **shapeSepolia.js** (id: 11011) - Shape Sepolia Testnet (OP Stack L2) with ETH native currency, multicall3 contract, sourceId for L1 reference

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Previously migrated**: ~271 (from iteration 370)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~276
- **Remaining**: 68 (~20% remaining, excluding generator script)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- Scroll Sepolia uses Blockscout as explorer
- Sei is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain with parallel EVM execution
- Shape is an OP Stack L2 built by the Mento team, includes sourceId pointing to Sepolia (11155111)

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. 68 remain (~20% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: shardeumSphinx, shibarium, shibariumTestnet, shimmer, skaleBlockBrawlers...
