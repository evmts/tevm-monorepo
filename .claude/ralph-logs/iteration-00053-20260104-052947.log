## Summary

I've successfully completed this migration iteration. Here's what was accomplished:

### Changes Made
1. **Implemented native `encodePacked` function** in `packages/utils/src/viem.js`:
   - Full support for all Solidity primitive types (uint8-256, int8-256, address, bool, string, bytes)
   - Support for fixed bytes (bytes1-bytes32)
   - Support for dynamic arrays (e.g., `uint8[]`, `address[]`)
   - Support for fixed-size arrays (e.g., `uint256[3]`)
   - Matches viem's API exactly

2. **Added comprehensive tests** (22 new tests) covering:
   - All numeric types including negative values with two's complement
   - String and bytes encoding
   - Array encoding (both dynamic and fixed)
   - Error handling for type mismatches and invalid inputs
   - Uint8Array input support

3. **Removed `encodePacked` from viem/utils imports** - the native implementation now handles this functionality

### Remaining viem/utils imports:
- `decodeAbiParameters`, `decodeErrorResult`, `decodeEventLog`, `decodeFunctionData`, `decodeFunctionResult`
- `encodeAbiParameters`, `encodeDeployData`, `encodeErrorResult`, `encodeEventTopics`, `encodeFunctionData`, `encodeFunctionResult`
- `serializeTransaction`

### Next steps for future iterations:
The `serializeTransaction` function could be a good next target as it has a clear EIP specification and is used for transaction signing. The ABI encoding/decoding functions are more complex and will require careful API compatibility work.
