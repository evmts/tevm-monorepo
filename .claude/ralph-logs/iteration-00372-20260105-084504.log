Let me check the current status of migrations by looking at what was accomplished in this session:

**Summary of this session (iterations 747-752):**

1. **Iteration 747**: Successfully migrated `toBeRevertedWithString.spec.ts` from `viem/actions` to client methods
2. **Iteration 748**: Successfully migrated `toBeRevertedWithError.spec.ts` from `viem/actions` to client methods
3. **Iteration 749**: Attempted `tevmMine.spec.ts` but reverted - uses basic `createClient` which requires functional pattern
4. **Iteration 750**: Successfully migrated `sendRawTransaction.spec.ts` from `viem/actions` to client methods
5. **Iteration 751**: Analyzed remaining viem imports and documented which can/cannot be migrated
6. **Iteration 752**: Attempted MemoryClient.ts type migration but reverted - simplified types not compatible

**Key findings:**
- Core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node) have no viem imports
- Files using `createMemoryClient` can be migrated from `viem/actions` to client methods
- Files using basic `createClient` from viem cannot be migrated (functional pattern is correct)
- Type imports from viem in memory-client cannot be migrated (need full generic types)
