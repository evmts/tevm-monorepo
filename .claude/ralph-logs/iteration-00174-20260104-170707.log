## Summary

I've completed a thorough verification of the migration status. Here's what I found:

### Migration Status: Excellent

**All core crypto operations are now using @tevm/voltaire:**
- Keccak256, Secp256k1, EIP712, P256, Address, Hash, Hex, Abi encoding

**Tests verified passing:**
- Bloom: 6/6
- Signature: 31/31  
- EIP7702: 22/22
- nativePrivateKeyToAccount: 18/18

### Remaining Dependencies (Intentional)

1. **viem** - Only kept for:
   - Memory-client compatibility layer (Client types)
   - Fork transport functions (http, webSocket, createPublicClient)
   - Deprecated account exports (native alternatives exist)

2. **@ethereumjs** - Deep integrations:
   - common (EVM hardfork configuration)
   - tx (impersonated transactions)
   - trie (Merkle Patricia Trie)

3. **@scure/bip39, @scure/bip32** - Blocked by voltaire FFI issue

### Next Steps for Future Iterations
1. Monitor voltaire for HDWallet FFI fix
2. Consider @ethereumjs/common migration when voltaire Chain support matures
3. Eventually remove deprecated viem account re-exports

The migration is essentially complete for the targeted scope. No code changes were needed this iteration.
