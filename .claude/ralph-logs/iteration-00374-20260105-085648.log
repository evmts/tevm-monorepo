The migration for this iteration is complete. I successfully:

1. **Removed the viem dependency from `@tevm/test-matchers`** by replacing `instanceof` checks for viem's `BaseError` with a duck-typed approach using the `isBaseErrorLike()` helper function.

2. **Key changes made:**
   - Removed `import { BaseError as ViemBaseError } from 'viem'`
   - Added `isBaseErrorLike()` type guard that checks for the `walk` method
   - Updated 3 locations that were using `ViemBaseError` instanceof checks

3. **Verification:**
   - TypeScript compiles without errors in the changed file
   - No viem imports remain in `extensions/test-matchers/src`
   - The duck-typing approach works because both viem and tevm BaseError have the same interface (particularly the `walk` method)

The `@tevm/test-matchers` package is now free of viem imports, making it one more package that can work independently of viem.
