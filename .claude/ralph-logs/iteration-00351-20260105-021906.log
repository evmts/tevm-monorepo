## Date: 2026-01-05 02:19

## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **iotex.js** (id: 4689) - IoTeX with IOTX native currency, includes webSocket URLs
2. **iotexTestnet.js** (id: 4690) - IoTeX Testnet with IOTX native currency, includes webSocket URLs
3. **jbc.js** (id: 8899) - JB Chain with JBC native currency
4. **jbcTestnet.js** (id: 88991) - Jibchain Testnet with tJBC native currency
5. **kaia.js** (id: 8217) - Kaia with KAIA native currency

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Total presets**: ~335
- **Previously migrated**: ~171 (from iteration 350)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~176
- **Remaining**: ~168 (~50% remaining)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- IoTeX chains: Use 'IOTX' (IoTeX) as native currency, include webSocket URLs
- JB Chain: Use 'JBC' as native currency
- Jibchain Testnet: Use 'tJBC' as native currency (testnet token)
- Kaia: Use 'KAIA' as native currency, has cross-referenced API URL to klaytnscope

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. ~168 remain (~50% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: kairos, karura, katla, kavaTestnet, kinto, klaytn...
