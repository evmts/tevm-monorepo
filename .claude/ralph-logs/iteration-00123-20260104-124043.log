## Iteration 173 Complete

**Summary**: Removed all `@ethereumjs` JSDoc references from the `@tevm/vm` package source files.

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `packages/vm/src/VmOpts.ts` - replaced `@ethereumjs/evm` with `{@link EvmType}`
- Updated `packages/vm/src/utils/VMOpts.ts` - replaced `@ethereumjs/evm` with `{@link Evm}`
- Updated `packages/vm/src/utils/RunBlockOpts.ts` - replaced `@ethereumjs/block` with `{@link Block}`
- Updated `packages/vm/src/utils/RunTxOpts.ts` - replaced `@ethereumjs/block` and `@ethereumjs/tx` with proper `{@link}` tags

**Verification**: 
```
grep -rn "@ethereumjs" packages/vm/src/ --include="*.ts"
# No output - all references removed
```

**Status**: The core packages (actions, vm, state, evm, node, blockchain) are now free of viem imports in their source files. The vm package is now also free of @ethereumjs JSDoc references. The main remaining ethereumjs dependency is `@ethereumjs/common` which is used in `createCommon.js` - this will require creating a native Common implementation, which is a larger undertaking.
