The commit was successful. Let me summarize what was accomplished in this iteration:

## Summary - Iteration 155

**Goal:** Migrate `CacheType` enum from `@ethereumjs/statemanager` to native implementation in `@tevm/utils`

**Changes Made:**
1. Created `packages/utils/src/cache-types.js` - Native JavaScript implementation of CacheType constant with JSDoc types
2. Updated `packages/utils/src/index.ts` - Added export for CacheType
3. Updated 6 files in `packages/state/src` to import CacheType from `@tevm/utils` instead of `@ethereumjs/statemanager`:
   - `ContractCache.js`
   - `createBaseState.js`
   - `actions/shallowCopy.js`
   - `actions/generateCannonicalGenesis.js`
   - `index.js`
   - `index.ts`

**Tests:** All tests pass (13 ContractCache tests, 4 createBaseState tests, 1 index test)

**Remaining work:** The state package still imports `AccountCache` and `StorageCache` classes from `@ethereumjs/statemanager`. These are complex classes with:
- LRU cache functionality
- OrderedMap cache functionality  
- Checkpoint/revert/commit state management
- Pre-allocation and size limits

Those would require substantial implementation work to replace natively.
