## Iteration 168 Complete

I successfully migrated `@tevm/blockchain` to use native consensus types and classes, removing the `@ethereumjs/blockchain` dependency from the source code.

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Created `Consensus.ts`** - Native interface matching @ethereumjs/blockchain's Consensus
2. **Created `CasperConsensus.js`** - Native Casper PoS consensus implementation that validates PoS blocks have difficulty 0
3. **Updated `createChain.js`** - Changed import to use local CasperConsensus
4. **Updated `Chain.ts`** - Added native `OnBlock` and `BlockchainEvent` types, removed @ethereumjs/blockchain import
5. **Updated `index.ts`** - Added exports for new types and CasperConsensus class

### Test Results:
- 17 tests pass
- 19 tests fail due to missing RPC environment variables (not related to migration)

### Remaining @ethereumjs Dependencies:
- `@tevm/tx`: Transaction classes (BLOCKED - needs class-based approach)
- `@tevm/common`: Hardfork configuration (BLOCKED - needs full hardfork system)
- `@tevm/trie`: Trie implementation (BLOCKED - needs native trie)
