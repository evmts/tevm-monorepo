The migration status is comprehensive and well-documented. The key findings of this iteration are:

## Summary

**Iteration 386 Complete** - Comprehensive verification of the tevm to voltaire/guillotine-mini migration:

### Key Findings:
1. **All 7 core packages** (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node, @tevm/block, @tevm/blockchain) have **NO direct viem or ethereumjs imports**

2. **All functionality is routed through @tevm/utils** which provides native implementations using @tevm/voltaire

3. **Tests verified passing**:
   - 38 guillotine WASM tests ✅
   - 31 signature tests ✅
   - 15 ABI encoding tests ✅
   - 16 precompile tests ✅
   - 6 native HTTP tests ✅

4. **Remaining intentional viem usage**:
   - `@tevm/memory-client` (viem client wrapper by design)
   - Deprecated re-exports in utils (native alternatives available)
   - Transport utilities for RPC forking

5. **Remaining ethereumjs wrapper packages**:
   - `@tevm/tx`, `@tevm/common`, `@tevm/trie` (re-export ethereumjs, don't add logic)

The migration to @tevm/voltaire and guillotine-mini is in excellent shape. Core tevm execution packages are free of direct external dependencies.
