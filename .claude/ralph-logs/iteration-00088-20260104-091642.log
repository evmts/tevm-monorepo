## Migration Iteration 133 Complete

I've successfully migrated the `Address` type from abitype to a native implementation:

**Changes made:**
1. Created `packages/utils/src/address-types.ts` with native `Address` type (`\`0x${string}\``)
2. Updated `packages/utils/src/abitype.ts` to export Address from the native implementation instead of abitype

**Test results:**
- All 540 tests pass in @tevm/utils
- All 29 tests pass in @tevm/contract

**Design decision:** Used a simple unbranded string-based `Address` type for backward compatibility with viem/abitype, rather than voltaire's branded Uint8Array-based `AddressType`.

**Remaining viem/abitype imports:** The remaining imports are complex generic types (like `Abi`, `AbiFunction`, etc.) that provide advanced TypeScript type inference and would require significant effort to replicate. These are good candidates for keeping as dependencies since they provide value without runtime overhead.
