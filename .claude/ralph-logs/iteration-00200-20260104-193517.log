## Iteration 254 Summary

I verified the current migration status:

**Tests Passing:**
- All guillotine WASM tests (26 passed)
- All createEvm tests (17 passed)  
- All utils tests (607 passed)
- Core eth action tests

**Current Migration State:**
- **Fully migrated to voltaire:** Keccak256, Secp256k1, P256, ABI encoding/decoding, account creation (native implementations), signature operations, EIP-7702, and all utility functions
- **Guillotine-mini integration:** Complete WASM execution with proper memory handling

**Remaining Dependencies (Intentional):**
- Viem transport/client functions for fork support (`http`, `createPublicClient`, etc.)
- `@ethereumjs/tx` FeeMarket1559Tx for impersonated transactions
- `@ethereumjs/common` for chain configuration

The core packages (actions, vm, evm, state, node) have no direct viem/ethereumjs imports in source code - all dependencies are properly abstracted through `@tevm/utils`.
