The migration status has been verified and documented. 

## Summary

**Migration Status: Complete for Core Crypto Primitives**

All 102 tests pass:
- Signature functions (31 tests)
- EIP-7702 utilities (22 tests)
- Native account implementations (35 tests)
- Bloom filter (6 tests)
- Ecrecover (7 tests)
- Prefunded accounts (1 test)

**Core packages** (`@tevm/actions`, `@tevm/vm`, `@tevm/evm`, `@tevm/state`, `@tevm/node`, `@tevm/block`) have no direct viem imports for crypto operations - all crypto is now backed by `@tevm/voltaire`.

**Remaining viem imports** are intentional:
1. Transport/forking functions (createPublicClient, http, etc.) - required for RPC communication
2. Memory-client viem compatibility layer

**Remaining @ethereumjs imports** are deep integrations that would require significant architectural changes:
1. `@ethereumjs/common` - Hardfork/chain configuration
2. `@ethereumjs/tx` - Impersonated transaction types
3. `@ethereumjs/trie` - Trie data structure

The uncommitted changes are stable and ready for commit when desired.
