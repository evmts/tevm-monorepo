I've completed iteration 190 of the Ralph migration. Here's a summary:

## Iteration 190 Summary

**Verified Migration Status:**
- All core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node, @tevm/contract, @tevm/block, @tevm/tx, @tevm/txpool, @tevm/address) have no direct viem imports
- Tests passing: viem.spec.ts (253 tests), abiEncoding.spec.ts (16 tests), createHandlers.spec.ts (15 tests)

**Commit Made:**
- **Consolidated SerializeToJson types** - Eliminated duplicate implementation by having @tevm/actions re-export from @tevm/utils
  - Added Error handling support (`Error & { code: number | string }`) to @tevm/utils version
  - Reduced code duplication between packages

**Remaining viem Dependencies (Intentional):**
1. Account creation (`mnemonicToAccount`, `privateKeyToAccount`) - for HD wallets and signing
2. Transport functions (`createPublicClient`, `http`, `webSocket`, etc.) - for forking

The core type migration from viem is complete. The remaining dependencies are intentionally kept for ecosystem interoperability.
