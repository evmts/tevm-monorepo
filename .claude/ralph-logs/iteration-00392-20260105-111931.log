I've completed iteration 823. Here's a summary:

## Iteration 823 Complete

**Task:** Added test coverage for `accumulateParentBeaconBlockRoot.ts` in `@tevm/vm`

**Changes:**
- Created `packages/vm/src/actions/accumulateParentBeaconBlockRoot.spec.ts` with 7 tests

**Test Coverage:**
1. EIP-4788 activation check - throws if not enabled
2. Account creation when beacon root address doesn't exist
3. No account creation when it already exists
4. Ring buffer storage for timestamp and root
5. Modular arithmetic for wrapping at historicalRootsLength (8191)
6. Boundary case at max index (8190)
7. Handling of timestamp zero

**Result:** All 7 tests passing

This file was one of several in the vm package without test coverage. The function implements EIP-4788 which enables the EVM to access historical beacon block roots via a ring buffer stored at a special precompile address (`0x000F3df6D732807Ef1319fB7B8bB8522d0Beac02`).
