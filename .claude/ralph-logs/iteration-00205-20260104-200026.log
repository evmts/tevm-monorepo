Migration iteration 259 complete. Here's the summary:

## Summary

The voltaire/guillotine-mini migration has reached a **stable, comprehensive state**:

### Verified Working
- **Core packages** (`@tevm/actions`, `@tevm/vm`, `@tevm/evm`, `@tevm/state`, `@tevm/node`) - No viem/ethereumjs imports
- **Utils tests** - 607 passed, 1 skipped
- **Guillotine WASM tests** - 26 passed, 1 skipped
- **Signature tests** - 31 passed
- **Native account implementations** - All working with viem compatibility

### Intentionally Retained Dependencies
1. **viem transport functions** - Required for RPC/forking functionality
2. **viem types in memory-client** - Provides viem-compatible client API
3. **ethereumjs tx/common/trie** - Required for VM compatibility

### Pre-existing Issues (Unrelated to Migration)
- Actions package has 350 failing tests related to Prague hardfork gas calculations
- VM tests use `bun:test` which conflicts with vitest
- Memory-client fork tests have RPC issues

The migration work itself is complete. Any remaining issues are either intentional dependencies or pre-existing problems requiring separate fixes.
