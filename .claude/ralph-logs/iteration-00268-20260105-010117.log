Migration complete for this iteration. 

**Summary:**
- Migrated `packages/common/src/presets/sepolia.js` from `viem/chains` to use `nativeDefineChain` from `@tevm/utils`
- Tests pass (10/10, 1 skipped)
- Types build successfully

The Sepolia testnet preset is now using the native chain definition pattern, removing another viem/chains dependency. This is a high-priority migration since Sepolia is the primary Ethereum testnet.
