## Summary

This iteration focused on assessing the current migration status. Here's what I found:

**Migration Status:**
- **Core packages are viem-free**: @tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node, @tevm/block, @tevm/jsonrpc, @tevm/precompiles
- **@tevm/utils**: Native implementations complete for accounts, crypto (using @tevm/voltaire), ABI encoding/decoding
- **Guillotine WASM**: Integration in place with 38 passing tests

**Remaining dependencies (intentional):**
1. `abitype` - For human-readable ABI parsing (acceptable)
2. `viem` - Only for transport/client creation for forking
3. `@ethereumjs/tx`, `@ethereumjs/common`, `@ethereumjs/trie`, `@ethereumjs/blockchain` - Large packages that would require significant reimplementation

**Test Results:**
- @tevm/utils: 607 tests passing
- @tevm/evm: 55 tests passing  
- @tevm/precompiles: 16 tests passing
- @tevm/actions: Tests passing

The migration is in a stable, well-tested state. The remaining work involves larger architectural decisions around replacing @ethereumjs packages (tx, trie, blockchain, common) which would be substantial undertakings.
