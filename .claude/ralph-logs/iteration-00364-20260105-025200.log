# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 364
## Date: 2026-01-05 02:52

## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **palm.js** (id: 11297108109) - Palm mainnet with PALM native currency, multicall3 contract, WebSocket support
2. **palmTestnet.js** (id: 11297108099) - Palm Testnet with PALM native currency, same contracts as mainnet, testnet flag set
3. **pgn.js** (id: 424) - Public Goods Network mainnet with ETH native currency, L2 contracts including l2OutputOracle, portal, l1StandardBridge (sourceId: 1 for mainnet)
4. **pgnTestnet.js** (id: 58008) - PGN Testnet (Sepolia-based) with ETH native currency, L2 contracts (sourceId: 11155111 for Sepolia)
5. **phoenix.js** (id: 13381) - Phoenix Blockchain with PHX native currency, multicall3 contract

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Total presets**: 335 (excluding generator script)
- **Previously migrated**: ~236 (from iteration 363)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~241
- **Remaining**: 104 (~31% remaining)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable), sourceId (if applicable)

## Notes
- palm/palmTestnet: Both use mainnet RPC URLs even for testnet (as per viem config)
- pgn/pgnTestnet: L2 chains with OP Stack style contracts keyed by chain ID
- phoenix: Simple chain with PHX token

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. 104 remain (~31% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: plinga, plumeTestnet, polygon, polygonAmoy, polygonMumbai...
