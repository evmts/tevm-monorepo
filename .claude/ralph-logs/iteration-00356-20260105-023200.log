# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 356
## Date: 2026-01-05 02:32

## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **localhost.js** (id: 1337) - Localhost chain with ETH native currency, simple local development configuration
2. **lukso.js** (id: 42) - LUKSO mainnet with LYX native currency, includes multicall3 contract and webSocket
3. **luksoTestnet.js** (id: 4201) - LUKSO Testnet with LYXt native currency, includes multicall3 contract and webSocket
4. **lycan.js** (id: 721) - Lycan chain with LYC native currency, has multiple http and webSocket URLs across global regions
5. **lyra.js** (id: 957) - Lyra Chain with ETH native currency, includes multicall3 contract

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Total presets**: ~335
- **Previously migrated**: ~196 (from iteration 355)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~201
- **Remaining**: 143 (~43% remaining)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- Localhost: Simple configuration with no block explorers, just local RPC
- LUKSO networks: Both mainnet and testnet have webSocket URLs configured
- Lycan: Has extensive geo-distributed RPC endpoints (US, EU, Asia)
- Lyra: Uses standard multicall3 address

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. 143 remain (~43% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: mandala, mantaSepoliaTestnet, mantaTestnet, mantleSepoliaTestnet, mantleTestnet...
