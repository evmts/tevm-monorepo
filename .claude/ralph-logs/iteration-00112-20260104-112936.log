The changes have been committed. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished in this iteration:

## Iteration 162 Summary

**Migration Goal Achieved**: Removed `@ethereumjs/evm` dependency from `@tevm/errors` package.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created native EVMError class** (`packages/errors/src/ethereum/EVMError.js`)
   - Full API compatibility with `@ethereumjs/evm` EVMError
   - `EVMError.errorMessages` static property with all EVM error message mappings
   - `EVMErrorTypeString` and `EVMErrorMessage` exports

2. **Updated 37 error files** to use native EVMError instead of `@ethereumjs/evm`
   - All imports now point to the native `EVMError.js`
   - JSDoc type annotations updated

3. **Removed dependency** from `packages/errors/package.json`

4. **Exported new types** from package index

### Test Results:
- @tevm/errors: 92 tests passed ✓
- @tevm/actions createHandlers.spec.ts: 15 tests passed ✓

### Migration Progress Notes:
- The EVM stub in `packages/evm/src/Evm.js` is still returning empty results (causing many @tevm/actions tests to fail with `executionGasUsed: 0n`)
- This is because guillotine-mini integration is not complete - the `runCall` method returns hardcoded empty results
- Remaining ethereumjs dependencies to migrate:
  - `@ethereumjs/blockchain` in @tevm/blockchain
  - `@ethereumjs/common` in @tevm/common
