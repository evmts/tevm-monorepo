## Summary

This iteration (308) was a verification pass confirming the migration stability. Key findings:

**Core Migration Status: COMPLETE**
- All core packages (`@tevm/actions`, `@tevm/evm`, `@tevm/state`, `@tevm/vm`, `@tevm/node`, `@tevm/block`, `@tevm/blockchain`) have **zero direct viem imports**

**Tests Verified:**
- 75 tests passed for native implementations (signature, privateKeyToAccount, mnemonicToAccount, createForkRpcClient, getForkClient)
- Forking tests require RPC environment variables (expected in production environments)

**Remaining viem usage is intentional** for user-facing API compatibility:
- `@tevm/memory-client` - Provides viem client compatibility
- `@tevm/utils` - Re-exports `http`, `webSocket`, etc. (deprecated, native alternatives available)

**Future opportunities identified:**
1. Voltaire's Transaction primitives could replace `@ethereumjs/tx`
2. Voltaire's Block primitives could reduce `@ethereumjs/block` dependency
3. `createTransport` migration would need API alignment work

The migration is stable and no immediate action items were identified.
