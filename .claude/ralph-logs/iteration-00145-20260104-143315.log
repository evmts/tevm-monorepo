## Summary

In this iteration (197), I:

1. **Created `nativePrivateKeyToAccount`** - A native implementation that provides a viem-compatible account interface using `@noble/curves` and `@noble/hashes` directly, without depending on viem for signing operations.

2. **Discovered a critical compatibility issue** - During testing, found that `@noble/curves` v2.x (used by @tevm/utils) has a different API than v1.x (used by viem). The `sign()` function returns raw bytes in v2.x but returns a Signature object with recovery info in v1.x. This means signatures produced by our native implementation are valid ECDSA signatures but don't match viem's exactly.

3. **Created comprehensive tests** - 14 tests all pass, covering:
   - Correct address derivation (matches viem exactly)
   - Public key format matching viem
   - Message signing functionality
   - Consistent deterministic signatures

4. **Documented the findings** - The iteration log captures the @noble/curves version compatibility issue for future reference.
