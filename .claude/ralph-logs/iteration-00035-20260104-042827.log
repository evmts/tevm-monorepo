Excellent! All viem imports in the core packages (actions, state, vm, evm, node) have been migrated!

## Summary

**Migration Iteration 49 Complete!**

Successfully migrated all remaining viem imports from test files in the core packages:

### Added to @tevm/utils:
- `stringToBytes` - Native implementation for UTF-8 string to bytes conversion
- `privateKeyToAccount` - Re-exported from viem/accounts
- `custom` - Transport function
- `http` - Transport function

### Test files migrated (15 files):
- 12 files in packages/actions
- 2 files in packages/state
- 1 file in packages/node

### Commits:
1. `9a3cbdfce` - Migrated decodeRevertReason.spec.ts + added concatHex
2. `5b37dc585` - Migrated remaining 14 test files

### Status:
**All viem imports in core packages (actions, state, vm, evm, node) have been successfully migrated to @tevm/utils!**

The only remaining viem references in these packages are JSDoc documentation examples (like `import { createClient } from 'viem'`), which are user-facing documentation showing how to use the APIs with viem.
