# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 368
## Date: 2026-01-05 03:01

## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **reyaNetwork.js** (id: 1729) - Reya Network with ETH native currency, WebSocket support, testnet: false
2. **rollux.js** (id: 570) - Rollux Mainnet (Syscoin L2) with SYS native currency, WebSocket support, multicall3 contract, apiUrl in block explorer
3. **rolluxTestnet.js** (id: 57000) - Rollux Testnet with SYS native currency, WebSocket support, multicall3 contract, apiUrl in block explorer, testnet flag
4. **ronin.js** (id: 2020) - Ronin chain (Sky Mavis) with RON native currency, multicall3 contract
5. **root.js** (id: 7668) - The Root Network with XRP native currency, WebSocket support, multicall3 contract

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Previously migrated**: ~256 (from iteration 367)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~261
- **Remaining**: 83 (~24% remaining, excluding generator script)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- Rollux is a Syscoin L2 chain using SYS as its native currency
- Ronin is the Axie Infinity chain using RON token
- Root Network uses XRP as its native currency (interesting choice for Ethereum L2)
- Reya Network has WebSocket support for real-time data

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. 83 remain (~24% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: rootPorcini, rootstock, rootstockTestnet, rss3, saigon...
