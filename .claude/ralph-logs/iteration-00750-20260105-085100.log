# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 750

## Task: Migrate sendRawTransaction.spec.ts from viem/actions to client methods

## Summary

Successfully migrated packages/memory-client/src/test/viem/sendRawTransaction.spec.ts to use client methods directly instead of importing from viem/actions.

## File Modified

### packages/memory-client/src/test/viem/sendRawTransaction.spec.ts

**Removed:**
```typescript
import { prepareTransactionRequest, signTransaction } from 'viem/actions'
```

**Changed function calls from:**
- `prepareTransactionRequest(mc, {...})` → `mc.prepareTransactionRequest({...})`
- `signTransaction(mc, {...})` → `mc.signTransaction({...})`

## Test Results

Test file compiles and runs successfully. The test is marked as `todo` (skipped) due to a pre-existing bug mentioned in comments.

## Analysis

This migration was possible because `createMemoryClient()` returns a `MemoryClient` which extends `Client` with `PublicActions`, `WalletActions`, and `TestActions`. These action methods are available directly on the client instance.

Files using basic `createClient()` from viem cannot be migrated without refactoring - they correctly use the functional pattern `action(client)`.

## Migration Progress

Successfully migrated:
- extensions/test-matchers/src/matchers/errors/*.spec.ts (3 files) ✅
- packages/memory-client/src/test/viem/sendRawTransaction.spec.ts ✅

Files that cannot be migrated (use basic createClient):
- packages/memory-client/src/tevmMine.spec.ts
- packages/memory-client/src/tevmContractIntegration.spec.ts
- packages/memory-client/src/tevmForkIntegration.spec.ts
- packages/memory-client/src/tevmAccountManagement.spec.ts
