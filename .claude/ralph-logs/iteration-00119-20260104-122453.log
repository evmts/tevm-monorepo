## Summary

I completed iteration 169 of the Ralph migration. Here's what was done:

### Changes Made
1. **packages/vm/src/actions/txLogsBloom.js** - Removed the unused `common` parameter from the function signature and updated the Bloom constructor call
2. **packages/vm/src/actions/applyTransactions.ts** - Removed unused second argument from Bloom constructor
3. **packages/vm/src/actions/runTx.ts** - Updated call to `txLogsBloom()` to not pass the unused `common` argument

### Context
The `Bloom` class in `@tevm/utils` only accepts an optional `bitvector` parameter, but these files were passing a second argument (`common` or `ethjsCommon`) that was completely ignored. This was dead code leftover from the ethereumjs migration.

### Test Results
- No new failures introduced
- Pre-existing failures are due to missing RPC environment variables and unrelated snapshot mismatches
