## Summary

This iteration discovered that **voltaire's HDWallet module has an FFI bundling issue** that prevents migration from `@scure/bip39` and `@scure/bip32`.

### What I attempted:
1. Migrated `nativeMnemonicToAccount.js` and `nativeHdAccount.js` to use `@tevm/voltaire/Bip39` and `@tevm/voltaire/HDWallet`
2. Tests failed due to FFI native build not being available

### Root Cause:
The voltaire dist build (`lib/voltaire/dist/crypto/HDWallet/index.js`) incorrectly bundles `ffi-napi` and `ref-napi` imports even though the source code uses pure JS implementations from `@scure/bip32`.

### Resolution:
Reverted all changes. The current implementation using `@scure/bip39` and `@scure/bip32` directly is correct and working.

### Current Status:
- **Core packages**: Fully migrated from viem in production source
- **Crypto operations**: Using voltaire's Secp256k1, EIP712, Keccak256 (no FFI issues)
- **HD Wallet**: Still uses @scure/bip39 and @scure/bip32 directly (blocked by voltaire FFI issue)
- **Transport/RPC**: Intentionally uses viem for forking functionality

The migration is in good shape overall. The voltaire HDWallet FFI bundling issue should be reported/fixed in the voltaire library itself before this migration can proceed.
