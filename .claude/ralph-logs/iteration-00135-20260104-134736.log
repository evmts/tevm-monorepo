## Summary - Iteration 186

I added a native `Prettify` utility type to `@tevm/utils` in preparation for migrating imports from `viem/chains`.

**Changes made:**
1. Created `packages/utils/src/utility-types.ts` with the `Prettify<T>` type (a simple mapped type that flattens TypeScript types for better display)
2. Added the export to `packages/utils/src/index.ts`

**Migration blocked:**
The migration of actual imports from `viem/chains` to `@tevm/utils` was blocked because:
- TypeScript resolves `@tevm/utils` through the generated `types/` directory
- Type generation fails due to pre-existing voltaire dist issues (strict mode TypeScript errors)

**Current status:**
- The native `Prettify` type is ready and will be available once the voltaire issues are fixed
- Core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node) remain free of direct viem imports
- The remaining viem dependencies are intentional integrations (memory-client, common presets, centralized re-exports)
