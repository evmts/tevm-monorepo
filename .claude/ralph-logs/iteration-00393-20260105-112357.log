Successfully added test coverage for `txLogsBloom.js`. This iteration added 9 tests covering:

1. Empty/undefined logs handling
2. Address addition to bloom filter
3. Topic addition to bloom filter  
4. Multiple logs handling
5. Logs with no topics
6. Logs with many topics
7. Accumulation across multiple logs
8. Verification that bloom filter is populated

All 9 tests pass. The `txLogsBloom` function is an internal utility that creates bloom filters from transaction logs for efficient log filtering.
