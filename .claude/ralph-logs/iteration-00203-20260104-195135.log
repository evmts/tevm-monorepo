## Iteration 257 Complete

**Summary**: Assessment iteration confirming the migration is stable and comprehensive.

**Key Findings**:
- Core packages (`@tevm/actions`, `@tevm/vm`, `@tevm/evm`, `@tevm/state`, `@tevm/node`) are clean of viem/ethereumjs imports
- All native implementations using `@tevm/voltaire` are working correctly
- Tests verified: guillotine-mini (26 passed), signature (31 passed), prefundedAccounts (1 passed), eip7702 (22 passed)

**Remaining Dependencies (Intentional)**:
1. **viem**: Transport functions for RPC communication (required for forking)
2. **@ethereumjs/tx**: Transaction object for impersonated transactions
3. **@ethereumjs/common**: Chain configuration
4. **@ethereumjs/trie**: Merkle Patricia Trie

The migration has reached its practical completion for the core execution path. The remaining dependencies are either:
- Required for functionality (transport, chain config)
- Deprecated but kept for backward compatibility (account functions)
- Complex to replace with diminishing returns (tx, trie)
