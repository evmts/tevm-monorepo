## Summary

**Iteration 237 Complete**

I investigated migrating `nativeHdAccount.js` from `@scure/bip39` and `@scure/bip32` to voltaire's `Bip39` and `HDWallet` modules.

**Key Finding**: Voltaire's HDWallet module has FFI (native) dependencies bundled into the distribution, causing Node.js errors:
```
Error: No native build was found for platform=darwin arch=arm64 runtime=node
```

The migration was **reverted** because:
1. Voltaire's `@tevm/voltaire/HDWallet` subpath bundles FFI code (`ffi-napi`, `ref-napi`) even though pure JS functions exist
2. The @scure libraries that voltaire wraps are already audited and widely used
3. No real dependency reduction since voltaire uses the same @scure libraries internally

**Migration Status**:
- Core packages (actions, vm, evm, state, node, block, jsonrpc) have no viem/ethereumjs imports in source files ✅
- All crypto functions (keccak256, secp256k1, P256) migrated to voltaire ✅
- HD wallet (@scure/bip39, @scure/bip32) stays as-is due to voltaire bundling issue
- Remaining viem usage is intentional (deprecated accounts, transport for forking)
