# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 358
## Date: 2026-01-05 02:37

## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **merlin.js** (id: 4200) - Merlin chain with BTC native currency, Bitcoin Layer 2
2. **metachain.js** (id: 571) - MetaChain Mainnet with MTC (Metatime Coin) native currency, includes multicall3
3. **metachainIstanbul.js** (id: 1453) - MetaChain Istanbul testnet with MTC native currency, includes multicall3
4. **metalL2.js** (id: 1750) - Metal L2 with ETH native currency, OP Stack chain with multicall3 and WebSocket support
5. **meter.js** (id: 82) - Meter chain with MTR native currency

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Total presets**: ~335
- **Previously migrated**: ~206 (from iteration 357)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~211
- **Remaining**: 133 (~40% remaining)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- Merlin: Bitcoin L2 chain using BTC as native currency
- MetaChain: Both mainnet and Istanbul testnet have custom multicall3 at 0x0000...003001
- Metal L2: OP Stack chain with standard multicall3 deployed
- Meter: Uses its own MTR token as native currency

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. 133 remain (~40% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: meterTestnet, metis, metisGoerli, mev, mint...
