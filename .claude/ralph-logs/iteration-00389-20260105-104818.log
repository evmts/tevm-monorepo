## Summary - Iteration 818

Successfully added comprehensive test coverage for 4 utility functions in `@tevm/utils` that were missing spec files:

### New Test Files Created:
1. **bytesToUnprefixedHex.spec.ts** - 8 tests for converting bytes to hex without '0x' prefix
2. **setLengthLeft.spec.ts** - 7 tests for left-padding Uint8Array with zeros
3. **concatBytes.spec.ts** - 8 tests for concatenating multiple Uint8Array values
4. **bytesToUtf8.spec.ts** - 8 tests for converting bytes to UTF-8 string including multi-byte characters

### Results:
- All 31 new tests pass
- These native implementations are part of the migration away from @ethereumjs/util

### Migration Status:
- Core packages (actions, vm, evm, state, node): ✅ No direct viem imports
- Chain presets: ✅ All 334 migrated to `nativeDefineChain`
- @tevm/utils: ✅ Most functions migrated to native implementations
- Remaining: Transport/client functions needed for RPC forking, parseAbi/formatAbi from abitype
