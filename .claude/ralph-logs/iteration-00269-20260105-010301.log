Successfully migrated two more chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain:

**Iteration 323**: Migrated `arbitrum.js` (Chain ID: 42161, Arbitrum One)
**Iteration 324**: Migrated `base.js` (Chain ID: 8453, Base L2)

Both tests pass and the migrations follow the established pattern from previous iterations. The high-priority chains (mainnet, optimism, sepolia, arbitrum, base) are now all migrated.

**Migration Progress Summary**:
- Migrated presets: mainnet, optimism, sepolia, arbitrum, base (5 total)
- Remaining presets: ~100+ files still using viem/chains
- Next suggested target: polygon.js
