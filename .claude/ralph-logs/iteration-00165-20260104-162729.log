The migration work for this iteration is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Summary

**Migrated** `keccak256` and `toHex` imports from `viem` to native `@tevm/utils` implementations in `nativeMnemonicToAccount.spec.ts`.

**Key decision**: Kept viem imports for signature verification functions (`verifyMessage`, `verifyTypedData`, `recoverAddress`) because:
- These are used to verify our native implementations are compatible with viem
- Our native versions have some API differences (BigInt handling, raw message objects)
- Using viem for verification ensures we're testing actual compatibility

**Tests**: All 17 tests in `nativeMnemonicToAccount.spec.ts` pass.

**Migration status**: Core packages (`@tevm/actions`, `@tevm/vm`, `@tevm/evm`, `@tevm/state`, `@tevm/node`) are already clean of direct viem imports. The remaining viem imports are either intentional for compatibility testing or backwards compatibility re-exports.
