All tests pass. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished in this iteration:

## Summary - Iteration 315

**Completed:**
1. Verified all existing native implementations are working correctly (140+ tests passing)
2. Explored migration paths for eliminating remaining viem/chains dependencies
3. **Added `tevmChainToViemChain` utility function** - converts @tevm/chains simple format to viem-compatible Chain format

**New Files:**
- `packages/utils/src/tevmChainToViemChain.js` - Chain format converter
- `packages/utils/src/tevmChainToViemChain.spec.ts` - 7 tests

**Modified Files:**
- `packages/utils/src/index.ts` - Added export for new function

**Key Findings:**
- @tevm/chains package exists with DefiLlama-sourced chain data, but doesn't include major chains like mainnet (chainId 1), Optimism (10), etc.
- This makes migrating @tevm/common's 336 viem/chains imports more complex
- The new `tevmChainToViemChain` utility provides infrastructure for future chain preset migration

**Tests Status:**
- 76 tests passed (1 skipped - known guillotine storage bug)
- All native implementations working correctly
