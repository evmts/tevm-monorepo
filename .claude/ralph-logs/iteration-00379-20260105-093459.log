The test compiles and runs (it's skipped due to being slow, not due to errors). The migration of `EIP1193RequestFn` from viem to @tevm/utils was successful.

## Summary

**Iteration 760 Complete**

Successfully migrated one file:
- `bundler-packages/mud/src/internal/decorators/mudStoreGetStorageAtOverride.spec.ts`: Changed `import { type EIP1193RequestFn } from 'viem'` to import from `@tevm/utils`

Attempted but reverted:
- Migration of `http` to `nativeHttp` in test-node spec files failed because `nativeHttp` doesn't fully match viem's `http` transport structure

The core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node) remain free of direct viem imports. The remaining viem usages are in:
1. Third-party library integrations (whatsabi)
2. Complex viem-specific types (account-abstraction)
3. Re-exports through @tevm/utils (acceptable - provides backward compatibility)
