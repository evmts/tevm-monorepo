## Iteration 244 Complete

**Summary**: Assessed the current migration status and verified all tests are passing.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Noble-curves to Voltaire migration is 100% complete** - All crypto primitives (Keccak256, Secp256k1, P256) now use voltaire
2. **Native account implementations are complete** - `nativePrivateKeyToAccount`, `nativeMnemonicToAccount`, `nativeHdAccount` work without viem
3. **Guillotine-mini WASM integration is functional** - 24 tests passing
4. **All tests passing**: 66 tests verified across utils and evm packages

**Remaining Dependencies (Intentional)**:
- viem transport functions for forking (required)
- memory-client viem integration (by design)
- @ethereumjs packages for chain config, transactions, trie (complex to replace)

**Recommendation**: The core voltaire migration is essentially complete. Further migration would involve:
1. Creating an Ethereum-spec bloom filter in voltaire
2. Potentially using guillotine-mini for transaction execution acceleration
3. Long-term removal of deprecated viem account exports
