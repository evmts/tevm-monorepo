Successfully committed. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Ralph Migration Summary - Iteration 177

### Committed Changes
Successfully committed 67 files with migration progress across multiple packages:

**Native Types Created:**
- `@tevm/common`: AccountFields, CliqueConfig, ConsensusAlgorithm, ConsensusType, CustomCrypto, EvmStateManagerInterface, StorageDump, StorageRange
- `@tevm/blockchain`: Consensus interface, CasperConsensus implementation
- `@tevm/utils`: Native AccountCache, StorageCache, Bloom class

**EVM Adapter Improvements:**
- Added `getPrecompile(address)` method
- Added `DEBUG` boolean flag
- Added proper custom precompile initialization

### Migration Progress

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| @ethereumjs/* source imports | ~7 files | ~7 files (types generated separately) |
| Native type coverage | Partial | Extended with 8 new common types |
| Tests passing | Core tests pass | Core tests pass (28/29) |

### Remaining EthereumJS Dependencies
1. `@ethereumjs/tx` - Transaction serialization (blocked on voltaire transaction support)
2. `@ethereumjs/common` - Chain configurations (Mainnet presets)
3. `@ethereumjs/trie` - Merkle Patricia Trie (fundamental data structure)
4. `@ethereumjs/evm` - Full EVM (native Evm stubs in place for guillotine-mini)

### Blockers
- voltaire type build fails with OOM error during `tsup --dts-only`
