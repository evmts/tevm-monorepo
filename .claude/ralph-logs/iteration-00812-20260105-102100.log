## Task: Improve test coverage for account-class.js

## Summary

Added tests to improve coverage of account-class.js, specifically targeting:
- The `set nonce` setter (lines 146-147)
- The `set balance` setter (lines 162-163)

## Changes Made

### Modified files:
- `packages/utils/src/account-class.spec.ts` - Added 4 new tests

### Test additions:
1. `should allow setting nonce` - Tests the nonce setter
2. `should allow setting balance` - Tests the balance setter
3. `should update isEmpty after setting nonce` - Verifies isEmpty reflects nonce changes
4. `should update isEmpty after setting balance` - Verifies isEmpty reflects balance changes

## Coverage Improvement

- account-class.js: 98.46% → 100% (statement)
- account-class.js: 97.36% → 97.5% (branch)  
- account-class.js: 88.88% → 100% (function)
- account-class.js: 98.46% → 100% (line)

Line and function coverage now at 100% for account-class.js.

## Status: COMPLETE
