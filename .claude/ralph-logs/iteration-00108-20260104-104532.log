## Iteration 157 Complete

Successfully migrated 3 spec test files in `@tevm/state` to import `CacheType` from `@tevm/utils` instead of `@ethereumjs/statemanager`:

1. **ContractCache.spec.ts** - 13 tests passing
2. **createBaseState.spec.ts** - 4 tests passing  
3. **getAccountAddresses.spec.ts** - 7 tests passing

This ensures the test files align with the implementation files that were already using the native `CacheType` from `@tevm/utils`. The `AccountCache` and `StorageCache` still need to be imported from `@ethereumjs/statemanager` as they are complex class implementations.
