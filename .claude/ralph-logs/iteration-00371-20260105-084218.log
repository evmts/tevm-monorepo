The migration was successful. There are still 57 viem imports in packages (mostly in memory-client which is the viem integration layer), and 2 remaining spec files in test-matchers that need migration.

**Summary:**
- Migrated `toBeReverted.spec.ts` to use client methods directly instead of importing from `viem/actions`
- Removed imports: `getTransactionReceipt`, `mine`, `sendTransaction`, `writeContract` from 'viem/actions'
- Changed all 12 function calls from `functionName(client, {...})` to `client.functionName({...})`
- Tests fail due to pre-existing gas limit infrastructure issue (same as iteration 745)
