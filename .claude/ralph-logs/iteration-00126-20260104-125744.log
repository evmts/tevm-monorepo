## Summary

In this iteration (176), I:

1. **Assessed the current migration status** - Found that previous iterations have made significant progress:
   - Native `AccountCache` and `StorageCache` in `@tevm/utils`
   - Native `Bloom` class in `@tevm/utils`
   - Native consensus types (`Consensus`, `CasperConsensus`, `OnBlock`, `BlockchainEvent`) in `@tevm/blockchain`
   - Native EVM types in `@tevm/common` (`ConsensusAlgorithm`, `ConsensusType`, `CustomCrypto`, etc.)
   - A stub `Evm` class in `@tevm/evm` for future guillotine-mini integration

2. **Identified a blocker** - The voltaire type build fails with an out-of-memory error, which prevents building types for packages that depend on voltaire.

3. **Fixed the native EVM implementation** to pass all tests:
   - Added `getPrecompile(address)` method for precompile lookups
   - Added `DEBUG` flag for trace logging
   - Updated `addCustomPrecompile` and `removeCustomPrecompile` to properly manage the `precompiles` Map and throw `MisconfiguredClientError` when `_customPrecompiles` is undefined
   - Updated `createEvm` to initialize custom precompiles and set the DEBUG flag

4. **Verified all tests pass**:
   - 14/14 EVM tests passing
   - 14/15 common/state tests passing (1 skipped)
