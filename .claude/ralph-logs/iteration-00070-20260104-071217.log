The migration is complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Migration Complete - Iteration 116

Successfully migrated `concatBytes` and `equalsBytes` from `@ethereumjs/util` to native implementations in `@tevm/utils`.

### Changes:
1. **New files created:**
   - `packages/utils/src/concatBytes.js` - Native implementation
   - `packages/utils/src/equalsBytes.js` - Native implementation

2. **Files modified:**
   - `packages/utils/src/ethereumjs.js` - Removed these functions from @ethereumjs/util exports
   - `packages/utils/src/index.ts` - Added exports from new implementations
   - `packages/utils/src/ethereumjs.spec.ts` - Updated test imports

### Why native instead of voltaire?
Initially attempted to import from `@tevm/voltaire`, but:
- Voltaire doesn't export deep paths
- The main voltaire import loads native FFI bindings that require platform-specific builds

Since these are simple pure-JS functions (no crypto), native implementations are cleaner and have zero dependencies.

### Tests passing:
- All @tevm/utils tests (380 passed)
- Downstream packages using these functions (address, receipt-manager) also pass
