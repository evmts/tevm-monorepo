Iteration 216 complete. I successfully migrated all 4 remaining `viem/accounts` imports in `@tevm/memory-client` test files to use `nativePrivateKeyToAccount` from `@tevm/utils`:

1. **sendRawTransaction.spec.ts** - migrated
2. **verifyTypedData.spec.ts** - migrated
3. **verifySiweMessage.spec.ts** - migrated
4. **verifyMessage.spec.ts** - migrated

The test failures are pre-existing gas limit issues unrelated to the account migration. All `viem/accounts` imports in the `@tevm/memory-client` package have now been eliminated, with only intentional re-exports and comparison test files remaining in `@tevm/utils`.
