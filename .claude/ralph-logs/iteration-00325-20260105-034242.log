The migration is in excellent shape. Here's a summary:

## Migration Status Summary

**Completed:**
- Chain presets: 343/343 migrated from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain
- Core packages (@tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node): No direct viem imports
- @tevm/utils: Extensive voltaire integration for crypto operations
- Guillotine WASM integration: Functional with 38 passing tests

**Remaining (intentional):**
- memory-client: Uses viem by design (viem client wrapper)
- Transport utilities for forking (http, webSocket, custom, createPublicClient)
- Test comparison files for validating native implementations
- @ethereumjs/common, @ethereumjs/tx, @ethereumjs/trie (larger migration targets)

**Test Health:**
- packages/utils: 662 tests pass
- packages/common: 18 tests pass
- packages/precompiles: 16 tests pass
- packages/evm guillotine: 38 tests pass

The voltaire migration for primitives is largely complete. The next major frontier would be integrating guillotine-mini as the actual EVM execution engine, which is a more significant architectural change.
