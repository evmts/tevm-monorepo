# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 359
## Date: 2026-01-05 02:39

## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **meterTestnet.js** (id: 83) - Meter Testnet with MTR native currency
2. **metis.js** (id: 1088) - Metis mainnet with METIS native currency, multicall3 support, multiple RPC endpoints including WebSocket
3. **metisGoerli.js** (id: 599) - Metis Goerli testnet with METIS native currency, multicall3 support
4. **mev.js** (id: 7518) - MEVerse Chain Mainnet with MEV native currency, multicall3 support
5. **mevTestnet.js** (id: 4759) - MEVerse Chain Testnet with MEV native currency, multicall3 support

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Total presets**: ~335
- **Previously migrated**: ~211 (from iteration 358)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~216
- **Remaining**: 128 (~38% remaining)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- Meter Testnet: Uses MTR as native currency, pairs with meter.js mainnet
- Metis: Layer 2 solution with multiple RPC endpoints and WebSocket support
- Metis Goerli: Testnet with apiUrl for block explorer
- MEVerse: Both mainnet and testnet have MEV as native currency with high blockCreated numbers for multicall3

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. 128 remain (~38% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: mintSepoliaTestnet, modeTestnet, moonbaseAlpha, moonbeamDev, moonbeam...
