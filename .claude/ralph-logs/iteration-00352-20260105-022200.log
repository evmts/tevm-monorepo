## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **kairos.js** (id: 1001) - Kairos Testnet with KAIA native currency, includes multicall3 contract
2. **kakarotSepolia.js** (id: 1802203764) - Kakarot Sepolia with ETH native currency
3. **karura.js** (id: 686) - Karura with KAR native currency, includes webSocket URLs
4. **kava.js** (id: 2222) - Kava EVM with KAVA native currency, includes multicall3 contract
5. **kavaTestnet.js** (id: 2221) - Kava EVM Testnet with KAVA native currency, includes multicall3 contract

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Total presets**: ~335
- **Previously migrated**: ~176 (from iteration 351)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~181
- **Remaining**: 163 (~49% remaining)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- Kairos: Kaia testnet, uses KAIA native currency
- Kakarot Sepolia: zkEVM on Sepolia, uses standard ETH
- Karura: Acala/Polkadot parachain, has webSocket URLs
- Kava: Cosmos-based EVM chain with multicall3
- Kava Testnet: Test network with multicall3 support

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. 163 remain (~49% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: kcc, klaytn, klaytnBaobab, koi, kroma...
