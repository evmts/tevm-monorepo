# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 748
## Date: 2026-01-05

## Task: Migrate toBeRevertedWithError.spec.ts from viem/actions to client methods

## Summary

Successfully migrated extensions/test-matchers/src/matchers/errors/toBeRevertedWithError.spec.ts to use client methods directly instead of importing from viem/actions.

## File Modified

### extensions/test-matchers/src/matchers/errors/toBeRevertedWithError.spec.ts

**Removed:**
```typescript
import { writeContract } from 'viem/actions'
```

**Changed all function calls from:**
- `writeContract(client, {...})` → `client.writeContract({...})`

## Changes Made

1. Line 6: Removed viem/actions import
2. All ~35 instances of `writeContract(client, ...)` → `client.writeContract(...)`

## Test Results

Tests fail due to pre-existing gas limit infrastructure issue (not related to this migration):
```
InternalError: tx gas limit 94952 is lower than the minimum gas limit of 190466
```

This is the same issue noted in iterations 745-746 and is not caused by the migration.

## Migration Progress

**MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: All `viem/actions` imports have been removed from test-matchers spec files!

Files migrated in iterations 745-748:
- toBeReverted.spec.ts ✅
- toBeRevertedWithString.spec.ts ✅
- toBeRevertedWithError.spec.ts ✅

Next targets:
- Continue searching for other viem imports in the codebase
