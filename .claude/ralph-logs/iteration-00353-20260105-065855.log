I've completed iteration 727. Here's a summary:

## Iteration 727 Summary

**Task**: Add Client and ClientConfig types to @tevm/utils

**Changes Made**:
1. Added `ClientConfig` type to `packages/utils/src/provider-types.ts` - Configuration options for creating a viem-compatible client
2. Added `Client` type to `packages/utils/src/provider-types.ts` - A viem-compatible client interface for making JSON-RPC requests  
3. Exported both types in `packages/utils/src/index.ts`

**Attempted but Reverted**:
- Tried to migrate `MemoryClientOptions.ts` and `CreateMemoryClientFn.ts` to use `@tevm/utils` types instead of viem
- Failed due to type compatibility issues - viem's `Account` type has complex TypedData generics that our simplified types don't match

**Build Status**: PASS

**Key Learning**: viem's type system has deep type-level programming (especially for `signTypedData` with `TypedDataDefinition` generics) that requires exact type matching. For client-facing public APIs like MemoryClient, we need to either:
1. Keep using viem types directly
2. Implement fully compatible types with all the TypedData generic constraints

The new types can be used for internal utilities and new code that doesn't need full viem compatibility.
