## Summary

This iteration (258) was an assessment of the current migration status. Key findings:

**Current State**: All core packages (`@tevm/actions`, `@tevm/vm`, `@tevm/evm`, `@tevm/state`, `@tevm/node`) are fully migrated with 0 viem and 0 ethereumjs imports. All tests are passing.

**Potential Targets Investigated**:
1. **voltaire BloomFilter** - Uses multiplicative hash, not keccak256. Incompatible with Ethereum spec. Cannot replace current Bloom.
2. **voltaire TransactionEIP1559** - Could theoretically replace ethereumjs FeeMarket1559Tx, but requires deep integration with VM and carries high risk.
3. **viem transports** - Required for RPC/forking functionality, no native replacement available.

**Conclusion**: The migration is stable and comprehensive. Remaining dependencies are at system boundaries with diminishing returns to migrate further. Recommend maintaining current state unless specific requirements emerge.
