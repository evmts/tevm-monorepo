# Ralph Migration Iteration 116 - Native concatBytes/equalsBytes Implementation

## Summary

Migrated `concatBytes` and `equalsBytes` from `@ethereumjs/util` to native implementations in `@tevm/utils`. These are now zero-dependency pure JavaScript functions based on the same algorithms used in `@tevm/voltaire`.

## Changes Made

### New Files
1. `packages/utils/src/concatBytes.js` - Native implementation of concatBytes
2. `packages/utils/src/equalsBytes.js` - Native implementation of equalsBytes

### Modified Files
1. `packages/utils/src/ethereumjs.js` - Removed `concatBytes` and `equalsBytes` from @ethereumjs/util exports
2. `packages/utils/src/index.ts` - Added exports from new native implementations
3. `packages/utils/src/ethereumjs.spec.ts` - Updated imports to use new native implementations

## Implementation Details

### concatBytes
```javascript
export const concatBytes = (...arrays) => {
    const totalLength = arrays.reduce((sum, arr) => sum + arr.length, 0)
    const result = new Uint8Array(totalLength)
    let offset = 0
    for (const arr of arrays) {
        result.set(arr, offset)
        offset += arr.length
    }
    return result
}
```

### equalsBytes
```javascript
export const equalsBytes = (a, b) => {
    if (a.length !== b.length) return false
    for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] !== b[i]) return false
    }
    return true
}
```

## Notes

Initially tried to import from `@tevm/voltaire` directly, but this caused issues:
1. The voltaire package doesn't export deep paths like `@tevm/voltaire/primitives/Bytes/concat.js`
2. Importing from the main `@tevm/voltaire` package loads native FFI bindings that require platform-specific builds

Since `concatBytes` and `equalsBytes` are simple pure-JS functions (no crypto, no FFI needed), implementing them natively is the cleaner solution and removes the dependency on both `@ethereumjs/util` AND avoids adding a voltaire dependency that would pull in native code.

## Tests Passed

- `packages/utils/src/ethereumjs.spec.ts` - 9 passed, 1 skipped
- All @tevm/utils tests - 380 passed, 1 skipped
- `packages/address/src/create2ContractAddress.spec.ts` - 2 passed (uses concatBytes)
- `packages/receipt-manager/src/` - 34 passed (uses concatBytes)

## Impact

Reduced dependency on `@ethereumjs/util` by 2 functions. The functions `concatBytes` and `equalsBytes` were previously re-exported from `@ethereumjs/util` which itself re-exported them from `ethereum-cryptography/utils.js`.

## Next Steps

Continue migrating other utilities from `@ethereumjs/util`. Potential targets:
- `setLengthLeft` - pad bytes to a specific length
- `bytesToUtf8` - convert bytes to UTF-8 string
- `bytesToUnprefixedHex` - convert bytes to hex without 0x prefix
