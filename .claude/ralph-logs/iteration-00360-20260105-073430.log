The migration is complete for this iteration. To summarize:
- Migrated 19 files to use `Client` type from `@tevm/utils` instead of `viem`
- Remaining viem dependencies in test-matchers are:
  1. `DecodeErrorResultReturnType` type (needs to be added to @tevm/utils)
  2. Various runtime functions from `viem/actions` (waitForTransactionReceipt, estimateGas, getTransaction, getTransactionReceipt)
  3. Various error/utility types in the errors handleTransaction.ts

This was a successful migration iteration that removed 19 direct viem `Client` type imports from the test-matchers extension!
