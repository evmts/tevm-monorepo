Good progress in this iteration! I fixed several critical issues:

1. **Fixed `toType` in @tevm/utils** to handle `Address`-like objects that have a `.bytes` property - this was causing "Cannot convert value of type object to bytes" errors

2. **Added `KECCAK256_RLP_ARRAY_BYTES` constant** - the bytes version of the `KECCAK256_RLP_ARRAY` hex string constant

3. **Fixed block header defaults** to use bytes constants (`KECCAK256_RLP_BYTES`, `KECCAK256_RLP_ARRAY_BYTES`) instead of hex strings for `uncleHash`, `transactionsTrie`, and `receiptTrie`

4. **Fixed PoS validation** in block header to compare bytes with bytes, not bytes with hex strings

### Test Progress:
- `@tevm/state`: 121/141 tests passing (86%)
- `@tevm/utils`: 551/551 tests passing (100%)
- `@tevm/actions createHandlers.spec.ts`: Now 6/15 tests passing (was 0/15 before this iteration)

The remaining failures in createHandlers are actual logic issues (gas limit tests expecting different values), not type conversion errors. The core block creation is now working properly.
