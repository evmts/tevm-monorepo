## Summary

In this iteration, I fixed several issues in the @tevm/utils and @tevm/errors packages:

### Changes Made:

1. **EVMError.errorMessages type fix** (`packages/errors/src/ethereum/EVMError.js`)
   - Removed the `@type {Record<string, string>}` annotation that was overriding the `as const` type inference
   - This allows proper literal type access like `EVMError.errorMessages.INVALID_JUMP`

2. **Fixed EthjsAddress.js module references** (`packages/utils/src/AccountCache.js`, `packages/utils/src/StorageCache.js`)
   - Changed JSDoc imports from non-existent `./EthjsAddress.js` to the actual `./address.js` module
   - The `EthjsAddress` type has been migrated to the native `Address` class

3. **Fixed StorageCache internal method usage**
   - Updated `_saveCachePreState` to use the existing `_getByHex` method instead of creating mock Address objects
   - Removed the unused `hexToBytes` helper function

4. **Fixed typeOutput.js type issues**
   - Added proper type casts for Address-like object handling
   - Removed unnecessary `@ts-expect-error` directive

5. **Updated utils tsconfig**
   - Added exclude patterns for spec files to prevent test type errors from blocking builds

### Test Results:
- All checkpoint/revert/commit tests pass (11 tests)
- createBaseState tests pass (4 tests)

### Remaining Blockers:
The @tevm/utils:build:types still fails due to implicit `any` type errors in the voltaire library's compiled output (`lib/voltaire/dist/primitives/Hex/index.js`). This is a voltaire library issue that needs to be fixed separately from the tevm packages migration.
