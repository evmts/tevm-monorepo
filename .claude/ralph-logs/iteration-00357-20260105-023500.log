# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 357
## Date: 2026-01-05 02:35

## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **mandala.js** (id: 595) - Mandala TC9 testnet with mACA native currency, Acala staging network
2. **mantaSepoliaTestnet.js** (id: 3441006) - Manta Pacific Sepolia Testnet with ETH native currency, includes multicall3
3. **mantaTestnet.js** (id: 3441005) - Manta Pacific Testnet with ETH native currency, includes multicall3
4. **mantleSepoliaTestnet.js** (id: 5003) - Mantle Sepolia Testnet with MNT native currency, includes multicall3
5. **mantleTestnet.js** (id: 5001) - Mantle Testnet with MNT native currency, includes multicall3

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Total presets**: ~335
- **Previously migrated**: ~201 (from iteration 356)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~206
- **Remaining**: 138 (~41% remaining)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- Mandala: Acala staging network with webSocket support
- Manta chains: Layer 2 on Ethereum, both testnet variants have multicall3 deployed
- Mantle chains: Both use MNT native currency, both have multicall3 deployed

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. 138 remain (~41% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: merlin, metachain, metachainIstanbul, metalL2, meter...
