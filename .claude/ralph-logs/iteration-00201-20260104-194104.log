The migration is in a stable and well-tested state. The remaining dependencies are:

**Viem dependencies (intentionally kept):**
- Client/transport types (`createPublicClient`, `http`, `webSocket`, etc.) - needed for fork functionality
- `Account`, `HDAccount` types - needed for viem client compatibility in memory-client
- `parseAbi` from abitype - complex human-readable ABI parser

**Ethereumjs dependencies (complex to migrate):**
- `@ethereumjs/tx` - Full transaction class with methods (hash, serialize, sign, etc.)
- `@ethereumjs/common` - Chain configuration and hardfork logic
- `@ethereumjs/trie` - Merkle Patricia Trie implementation

All these remaining dependencies are either:
1. Complex to implement (transaction class, trie)
2. Required for core viem compatibility (client types)
3. Used as re-exports that don't affect the core runtime

The current iteration (255) confirms all tests are passing and the migration is stable. Future migration efforts should focus on:
1. Creating a voltaire-based transaction wrapper if needed
2. Implementing chain configuration natively
3. Potentially using voltaire's provider module for fork transport
