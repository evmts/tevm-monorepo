# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 394
## Date: 2026-01-05 04:37

## Changes Made

### Migrated numberToHex import to @tevm/utils in test-node test constants

1. **extensions/test-node/src/test/constants.ts**
   - Changed `import { numberToHex } from 'viem'`
   - To `import { numberToHex } from '@tevm/utils'`

## Test Results

- Ran `eth_getBlockByNumber.spec.ts` to verify the import works
- 1 test passed (uses BLOCK_NUMBER from constants.ts which uses numberToHex)
- 1 test failed due to missing TEVM_RPC_URLS_MAINNET env var (pre-existing issue, unrelated to migration)

## Notes

- The constants.ts file only needed numberToHex from viem
- This was a simple import swap since @tevm/utils re-exports numberToHex from viem
- Multiple test files import from this constants file, so this change affects many tests

## Next Steps

- Continue migrating simple viem imports (numberToHex, Hex type, Address type) in test-node
- Look at test/methods/*.spec.ts files for more migration opportunities

## Rationale

Small incremental migration of a utility file used by multiple tests.
