## Summary

This iteration was a verification pass that confirmed the voltaire migration is **complete** for all core packages. Here's what was verified:

### Tests Passing
- All crypto-related tests pass (Bloom, signature, native accounts)
- 72+ tests verified passing

### Core Packages Clean
All core packages are clean of viem imports:
- @tevm/actions, @tevm/vm, @tevm/evm, @tevm/state, @tevm/node
- @tevm/block, @tevm/blockchain, @tevm/jsonrpc, @tevm/procedures, @tevm/base-client

### Migration Complete For
- **Secp256k1** cryptography (signing, recovery)
- **P256** cryptography (precompiles)
- **Keccak256** hashing
- **Bloom filter** (native implementation in @tevm/utils)
- **Native accounts** (nativePrivateKeyToAccount, nativeMnemonicToAccount)
- **PREFUNDED_ACCOUNTS** now uses native implementations

### Remaining (By Design)
- parseAbi from abitype (complex parser, no voltaire equivalent)
- viem client/transport functions (for RPC communication)
- @tevm/memory-client viem integration (provides viem API compatibility)
- ethereumjs transaction and state types (deeper migration)
