Successfully completed iteration 144. 

**Summary**: Migrated `abiEncoding.js` to use local `./hex-types.js` Hex type instead of `import('viem').Hex` in 3 places. All 16 tests pass and types build successfully.

**Next steps**: Continue with `eip7702.js` which has 6 more Hex references that can be migrated to local types.
