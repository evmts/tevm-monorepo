The iteration is complete. Let me summarize what was accomplished:

## Summary - Iteration 808

**Task:** Improve test coverage for `abiEventEncoding.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Added 3 new tests to `packages/utils/src/abiEventEncoding.spec.ts`:
  1. Test for empty ABI handling in non-strict mode (returns undefined)
  2. Test for mismatched event selector in non-strict mode (returns undefined)  
  3. Test for uint256[] array type decoding in event data

**Coverage Improvement:**
- `abiEventEncoding.js`: 90.15% → 93.26% (+3.11%)
- Branch coverage: 77.77% → 80.48% (+2.71%)
- Overall utils coverage: 95.46% → 95.54%

**Remaining uncovered lines:** 135-136, 141-142 - These handle edge cases for Uint8Array value conversion that may not be hit because voltaire returns native types directly.
