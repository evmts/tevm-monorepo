# Ralph Migration Log - Iteration 367
## Date: 2026-01-05 03:00

## Summary
Migrated 5 chain presets from viem/chains to nativeDefineChain.

## Chains Migrated This Session

1. **qMainnet.js** (id: 35441) - Q Mainnet with Q native currency, explorer with apiUrl
2. **qTestnet.js** (id: 35443) - Q Testnet with Q native currency, explorer with apiUrl, testnet flag
3. **real.js** (id: 111188) - re.al chain with reETH native currency, multicall3 contract, apiUrl in block explorer
4. **redbellyTestnet.js** (id: 153) - Redbelly Network Testnet with RBNT native currency, Routescan explorer with apiUrl, testnet flag
5. **redstone.js** (id: 690) - Redstone L2 (OP Stack) with ETH native currency, WebSocket support, L2 contracts (gasPriceOracle, l1Block, l2CrossDomainMessenger, etc.), sourceId

## Tests Verified
- createCommon.spec.ts: 10 passed, 1 skipped (consistent)

## Migration Progress
- **Previously migrated**: ~251 (from iteration 366)
- **Migrated this session**: 5
- **Total migrated**: ~256
- **Remaining**: 88 (~26% remaining, excluding generator script)

## Pattern Used
Each migration follows this pattern:
1. Replace `import { X as _X } from 'viem/chains'` with `import { nativeDefineChain } from '@tevm/utils'`
2. Replace `..._X` spread with `...nativeDefineChain({...})` inline configuration
3. Configuration includes: id, name, nativeCurrency, rpcUrls, blockExplorers, contracts (if applicable), testnet (if applicable)

## Notes
- Redstone is an OP Stack L2 chain with full L2 contract definitions
- re.al uses reETH as its native currency (unique)
- Q chains use Q token as their native currency
- Redbelly uses Routescan for block exploration

## Next Steps
Continue migrating remaining chain presets. 88 remain (~26% remaining).
Next chains to migrate: reyaNetwork, rollux, rolluxTestnet, ronin, rootstock...
