### Current Status - EXCELLENT âœ…
- **Integration tests**: PASSING âœ…
- **Opcodes tests**: PASSING âœ… 
- **Gas tests**: PASSING âœ…
- **Server tests**: PASSING âœ…
- **Stack operations**: All DUP, SWAP, PUSH, POP operations working perfectly

- **Storage operations**: SLOAD, SSTORE operations working correctly
- **Control flow**: JUMP, JUMPI, RETURN, REVERT all working correctly

### Key Fixes Applied
- **Stack parameter order correction in JUMPI**: Fixed destination/condition parameter assignment
- **Stack parameter order correction in RETURN**: Fixed size/offset parameter assignment  
- **Stack parameter order correction in REVERT**: Fixed size/offset parameter assignment

### Original Root Cause Analysis

Primary Issue was stack parameter order in opcodes using `pop2_unsafe()`. The issue occurred when stack parameters were assigned to the wrong variables due to misunderstanding of `pop2_unsafe()` return values.

## Detailed Failures

### Integration Test Suite (7 failures)

#### 1. Memory operations with arithmetic
- **Error**: Expected 30, found 0 (stack value mismatch)
- **Location**: `test/evm/integration/memory_storage_test.zig:39`
- **Root Cause**: Stack computation not working correctly after memory operations

#### 2. Memory copy operations  
- **Error**: OutOfGas error in `frame.consume_gas(expansion_gas_cost)`
- **Location**: `src/evm/execution/memory.zig:100` called from MSTORE operation
- **Root Cause**: Memory expansion gas calculation appears to be consuming too much gas

#### 3. MSTORE8 with bitwise operations
- **Error**: Expected large number, found 0 (memory read returning wrong value)
- **Location**: `test/evm/integration/memory_storage_test.zig:222`
- **Root Cause**: Memory write/read operations not working correctly

#### 4. Memory expansion tracking
- **Error**: Expected 32, found 96 (incorrect memory size calculation)
- **Location**: `test/evm/integration/memory_storage_test.zig:298`
- **Root Cause**: Memory expansion logic calculating wrong size

#### 5. Return data handling
- **Error**: OutOfGas error in MSTORE operation
- **Location**: `test/evm/integration/control_flow_test.zig:159`
- **Root Cause**: Same gas consumption issue as #2

#### 6. Revert with reason
- **Error**: Expected 20, found 0 (return data size issue)
- **Location**: Related to REVERT opcode execution
- **Root Cause**: REVERT operation not preserving return data correctly

#### 7. Gas measurement with complex operations
- **Error**: Expected specific gas amount, test failing
- **Root Cause**: Gas calculations changed due to memory operation modifications

### VM Opcode Test Suite (13 failures)

Multiple failures in:
- Stack operations (DUP, SWAP operations)
- Memory operations (MLOAD, MSTORE variants) 
- Arithmetic operations with memory interaction
- All showing similar patterns to integration tests

### Opcodes Test Suite (18 failures)

Similar patterns:
- Stack underflow errors in operations that should have sufficient stack
- Memory operation failures
- Gas consumption mismatches

## Key Problem Areas

### 1. Memory Expansion Gas Calculation
The memory expansion gas cost calculation in `src/evm/execution/memory.zig:100` appears to be calculating excessive gas costs, causing OutOfGas errors in operations that should succeed.

### 2. Stack Validation Issues  
Stack validation is failing for operations that should have sufficient stack items, suggesting either:
- Stack state not being maintained correctly
- Validation logic changed incorrectly
- Test setup issues

### 3. Memory Size Calculation
Memory size tracking is returning incorrect values (96 instead of 32), suggesting the memory expansion logic was modified incorrectly.

## Most Productive Fix Strategy

Based on the failure patterns, the most productive fix would be to **focus on the memory expansion gas calculation issue first**, as it appears to be the root cause of many cascading failures.

### Specific Investigation Points:

1. **Memory gas calculation** in `src/evm/execution/memory.zig:100`
2. **Memory expansion logic** that's returning wrong sizes  
3. **Stack state management** during memory operations

The memory operations are fundamental and used throughout the EVM, so fixing the gas calculation and memory expansion logic should resolve a large number of the test failures.

## Changes That May Have Caused Issues

Looking at the git diff, significant changes were made to:
- `src/evm/execution/memory.zig` (31 lines changed)
- `src/evm/execution/control.zig` (24 lines changed) 
- Multiple new test files that may have different expectations

The memory.zig changes are likely the primary culprit for the cascading failures.
