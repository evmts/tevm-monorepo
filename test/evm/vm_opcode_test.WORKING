VM opcodes test fixes:

1. Fixed SUB large numbers test bytecode issue:
   - The bytecode array had incorrect byte count
   - Line with multiple bytes (0x00, 0x00, ...) had only 7 bytes instead of 8
   - This caused SUB opcode to be at wrong position (index 68 instead of 66)
   - Need to ensure each PUSH32 has exactly 32 bytes of data

The test expects:
- PUSH32 0x8000...000 (2^255) 
- PUSH32 0x4000...000 (2^254)
- SUB (should compute 2^255 - 2^254 = 2^254)
- STOP

All other vm-opcode tests pass correctly.
