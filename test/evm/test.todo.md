**Instructions for Multi-Agent EVM Debugging Workflow**

This is important. You are a multi agent so you should be on a loop marking test failure as in progress working in a worktree and then merging back

**Overall Goal:** Collaboratively resolve all failing EVM tests by assigning specific failure categories or individual test failures to different AI agents. Each agent will work in an isolated Git worktree, merge successful fixes back into the main development branch, and update a shared `test.todo.md` file to track progress.

**Identifier Scheme for Worktrees:**
Each agent will create a worktree using the format: `g/evm-fix-<category_or_test_name>`
Examples:
*   `g/evm-fix-stack-validation`
*   `g/evm-fix-op-gt`
*   `g/evm-fix-memory-mstore`
*   `g/evm-fix-log-gas`

**Workflow for Each Agent:**

1.  **Assign a Task:**
    *   Manually assign a specific failing test or a category of related failures (e.g., "Stack Validation Failures", "Arithmetic Opcode Failures - GT", "Memory MSTORE issues") from the `test.todo.md` file to an agent.
    *   Prioritize tasks based on potential impact (e.g., core component fixes before highly specific test fixes) or by grouping similar errors.

2.  **Update `test.todo.md` - Mark "In Progress":**
    *   Before starting work, the assigned agent (or a human coordinator) **MUST** update the `test.todo.md` file.
    *   Locate the relevant failure message(s) in the markdown file.
    *   Add a note directly under the failure message:
        ```markdown
        *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS - Agent <Agent_Identifier_Or_Name> - Worktree: `g/evm-fix-<your_identifier>`
        ```

3.  **Create Git Worktree:**
    *   Ensure you are on the main development branch (e.g., `06-02-feat_implement_jump_table_and_opcodes`).
    *   Pull the latest changes: `git pull origin 06-02-feat_implement_jump_table_and_opcodes`
    *   Create a new worktree for your assigned task. Replace `<your_identifier>` with the one chosen in step 1.
        ```bash
        git worktree add g/evm-fix-<your_identifier> -b feat/evm-fix-<your_identifier>
        ```
    *   Navigate to the new worktree directory:
        ```bash
        cd g/evm-fix-<your_identifier>
        ```

4.  **Implement Fixes and Debug:**
    *   Refer to the detailed analysis for your assigned failure(s) in `test.todo.md` (the prompt sections including Theory, Logging, Coding Changes, Plan).
    *   Implement the suggested logging if the cause is unclear. Analyze logs.
    *   Implement the proposed coding changes or your own derived fixes in the relevant `src/evm/**/*.zig` files or test files (`test/evm/**/*.zig`).
    *   Iteratively build and run the specific failing test(s) you are addressing. Use focused test commands if possible (e.g., `zig build test-opcodes -Dtest-filter="Test Name"` or similar, depending on your test runner setup).
        ```bash
        zig build && zig build test # Or more specific test command
        ```

5.  **Verify Fix and Check for Regressions:**
    *   Once your assigned test(s) pass, run the *entire relevant test suite* (e.g., `zig build test-opcodes` or `zig build test-integration`) to ensure your changes haven't introduced new failures (regressions) within that suite.
    *   If time permits and changes are core, consider running all test suites (`zig build test-all`).

6.  **Commit Changes:**
    *   Stage your changes: `git add src/evm/your_changed_file.zig test/evm/your_changed_test.zig`
    *   Commit with a clear message describing the fix. Reference the original failure if possible.
        ```bash
        git commit -m "fix(evm): Correct GT opcode operand order for comparison tests"
        git commit -m "test(evm): Adjust Fibonacci sequence test logic for accurate simulation"
        ```

7.  **Integrate Changes into Main Development Branch:**
    *   Switch back to the main development branch's working directory (NOT the worktree):
        ```bash
        cd ../..
        # (Assuming your workspace root is two levels up from g/evm-fix-<identifier>)
        # Ensure you are in the main workspace directory, not the worktree's.
        ```
    *   Ensure your main branch is up-to-date:
        ```bash
        git checkout 06-02-feat_implement_jump_table_and_opcodes
        git pull origin 06-02-feat_implement_jump_table_and_opcodes
        ```
    *   Cherry-pick the commit(s) from your worktree's branch:
        ```bash
        git cherry-pick feat/evm-fix-<your_identifier>
        ```
        (If you made multiple commits in your worktree branch, you might cherry-pick a range or squash them first on the worktree branch before cherry-picking).
    *   Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur.
    *   Run all test suites again on the main development branch to ensure integration was successful:
        ```bash
        zig build && zig build test-all
        ```

8.  **Update `test.todo.md` - Mark "Complete" and Report:**
    *   Edit the `test.todo.md` file on the `06-02-feat_implement_jump_table_and_opcodes` branch.
    *   Find your "IN PROGRESS" entry.
    *   Update the status and add a brief report:
        ```markdown
        *   **Status:** COMPLETE - Agent <Agent_Identifier_Or_Name> - Worktree: `g/evm-fix-<your_identifier>`
        *   **Report:**
            *   **Fix:** Corrected operand order in `op_gt` and `op_lt` in `src/evm/opcodes/comparison.zig`.
            *   **Tests Fixed:** `arithmetic_sequences_test.test.Integration: Conditional arithmetic based on comparison`, potentially `vm-opcode-test.test.VM: Conditional logic with comparison`.
            *   **Regressions Checked:** Ran `integration-test` and `opcodes-test` suites, no new failures.
            *   **Commit SHA (on 06-02-feat_implement_jump_table_and_opcodes after cherry-pick):** `<paste_commit_sha_here>`
        ```

9.  **Clean Up Worktree:**
    *   Once changes are successfully integrated and verified on the main development branch:
        ```bash
        git worktree remove g/evm-fix-<your_identifier>
        git branch -D feat/evm-fix-<your_identifier>
        ```

10. **Push Main Branch (Optional - Coordinator Task):**
    *   A human coordinator or a designated agent should periodically push the `06-02-feat_implement_jump_table_and_opcodes` branch to the remote repository after several fixes have been integrated.
        ```bash
        git push origin 06-02-feat_implement_jump_table_and_opcodes
        ```

**Coordination Notes:**

*   **Avoid Overlapping Work:** A human coordinator should try to assign tasks that are as isolated as possible to minimize merge conflicts. If two agents need to modify the same file for different issues, careful coordination or sequential work on that file might be necessary.
*   **Regularly Update Main Branch:** Agents should regularly pull from the main development branch into their worktree's feature branch (`git pull origin 06-02-feat_implement_jump_table_and_opcodes`) to stay updated and reduce the complexity of the final cherry-pick/merge.
*   **Communication:** If an agent discovers a fix that might impact other areas or resolve other listed failures, this should be communicated (e.g., by updating the `test.todo.md` with cross-references or notes).

This workflow should allow multiple agents to work in parallel while maintaining a structured approach to fixing the test failures and tracking progress.


**Introduction**

You are an AI coding assistant tasked with debugging and refining a Zig-based Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation. The project has progressed to a stage where core EVM components, including opcode execution logic and a jump table dispatch mechanism, have been developed. However, a comprehensive suite of automated tests is revealing numerous failures across various aspects of EVM functionality. These failures span arithmetic operations, memory management, storage interactions, control flow, system calls, and gas accounting.

Your primary objective is to work through a detailed analysis of these test failures (which will be provided subsequently) to identify and rectify bugs within the Zig EVM source code (primarily located in `src/evm/`) or, if necessary, to correct inaccuracies in the test cases themselves (located in `test/evm/`). You will be provided with specific failure messages, theories about the root causes, suggestions for logging, potential coding changes, and a plan for addressing each category of error.

The overall goal is to achieve a robust and correctly functioning EVM implementation that passes all provided tests, adhering to Ethereum specifications and Zig best practices.

---

**Success Criteria**

The debugging and fixing process will be considered successful when the following criteria are met:

1.  **All Test Suites Pass:**
    *   All tests within the `integration-test` suite must pass.
    *   All tests within the `opcodes-test` suite must pass.
    *   All tests within the `vm-opcode-test` suite must pass.
    *   All tests within the `stack-validation-test` suite must pass.
    *   All other provided EVM-related tests must pass.

2.  **No Regressions:** Fixes applied should not introduce new failures in previously passing tests.

3.  **Correct EVM Behavior:** The EVM implementation must accurately reflect the behavior defined in Ethereum specifications (e.g., Yellow Paper, relevant EIPs) for all tested opcodes and scenarios. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Correct stack manipulation (depth, push/pop order, overflow/underflow handling).
    *   Accurate memory expansion and data access.
    *   Correct state modification logic for storage (SSTORE, TSTORE) and account state.
    *   Proper gas accounting for all opcodes, including base costs, dynamic costs (memory, hashing, etc.), and EIP-2929 cold/warm access costs.
    *   Valid control flow (JUMP, JUMPI, JUMPDEST validation).
    *   Correct handling of system opcodes (CREATE, CALL variants, LOGs, SELFDESTRUCT, etc.), including static call protections.
    *   Accurate retrieval and processing of environment and block information.

4.  **Code Quality:**
    *   Implemented fixes should be clear, maintainable, and follow Zig best practices.
    *   Solutions should be efficient and consider performance implications, especially in hot paths of EVM execution.
    *   Memory safety must be ensured, with proper handling of allocations and deallocations.

5.  **Problem Resolution:** The underlying causes of the identified test failures should be addressed, not just patched to make tests pass superficially. If a test is found to be flawed, it should be corrected to accurately reflect desired EVM behavior.

---

**Objective:** Resolve all failing EVM tests by identifying and fixing bugs in the Zig EVM implementation (`src/evm/**/*.zig`) or the tests themselves (`test/evm/**/*.zig`).

**Methodology:** For each failing test listed below, analyze the failure message, the provided theory, logging suggestions, potential coding changes, and the plan. Implement the necessary fixes or logging, rerun tests, and iterate until the test passes. Prioritize fixes that might address multiple failures (e.g., issues in core components like Stack, Memory, Gas Accounting, or JumpTable).

---
<prompt_preamble>
You are an expert Zig and EVM engineer. Your task is to help me debug a series of test failures in my Zig EVM implementation. I have provided detailed test output which includes specific error messages, failing test names, and relevant `JumpTable` logs showing opcode execution and gas consumption. I also have access to the `revm` (Rust EVM) source code as a reference for correct EVM behavior.

For each failing test or group of related failing tests, please perform the following:
1.  **Analyze the Failure**: Based on the test name, expected vs. found output, error messages, and `JumpTable` logs, explain what the test is trying to achieve and precisely how it's failing in my Zig EVM.
2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis**: Propose the most likely root cause(s) of the bug in the Zig implementation. Consider issues with opcode logic, gas calculation, stack/memory manipulation, state updates, or error handling.
3.  **Suggest Logging (Zig Code)**: Identify specific locations in the Zig source code (e.g., `src/evm/opcodes/*.zig`, `src/evm/memory.zig`, `src/evm/frame.zig`, `src/evm/vm.zig`, `src/evm/jump_table.zig`) where `std.debug.print` statements would be most effective for diagnosis. Specify what variables or state (e.g., stack contents, memory snippets, gas values, function parameters, return values) should be logged at these points.
4.  **Propose a Fix Strategy**: Outline the steps to verify the hypothesis and fix the bug. This might involve comparing logic with `revm` (I've provided relevant `revm` file paths in the initial query), stepping through data transformations in the Zig code, or correcting specific calculations or state updates.
5.  **Provide Code Snippets**: If applicable, include brief Zig code snippets for logging (using `std.debug.print`) or conceptual fixes. Use `// ... existing code ...` to indicate context. If showing `revm` code for comparison, clearly label it.

Let's proceed systematically through the failures.

<debugging_session>

  <test_failure_group name="CREATE_CREATE2_ZeroAddress">
    *   **Status:** TODO
    *   **Report (Previous):**
        *   **Fix:** Implemented CREATE/CREATE2 address calculation with RLP encoding and keccak256, added nonce tracking to VM
        *   **Tests Fixed:** CREATE/CREATE2 now return calculated addresses instead of 0
        *   **Regressions Checked:** Basic implementation working, actual initcode execution still TODO
        *   **Commit SHA:** 03f4b7ee1
    <failure_summary>
      Tests `system_test.test.CREATE: create new contract` and `system_test.test.CREATE2: create with deterministic address` are failing.
      - `CREATE` output: `expected ..., found 0`
      - `CREATE2` output: `expected ..., found 0`
      The `JumpTable` logs now show:
      - Initial gas: 100000
      - Constant gas consumed: 32000 (remaining: 68000)
      - Gas after `op_execute`: 68000
      This indicates that after the base gas for CREATE/CREATE2 is consumed, no further gas is used by `op_execute`. This strongly suggests the initcode execution (the sub-call) is either not happening, or it's consuming zero gas and failing/returning immediately *before* any initcode could run. The previous "actual initcode execution still TODO" is critical.
    </failure_summary>
    <hypothesis>
      1.  **Primary Issue: Initcode Execution Not Implemented or Failing Early:** The initcode execution (sub-call within `op_create`/`op_create2`) is not being correctly invoked, or it's failing before consuming any gas allocated to it. This causes the creation to effectively fail, returning address `0`.
      2.  **Gas Forwarding/Allocation:** The gas allocated to the initcode sub-call might be zero or incorrectly calculated, leading to an immediate OOG within the sub-call if it even starts. The "63/64th rule" (EIP-150) for gas forwarding needs to be correctly applied.
      3.  **Return Data Handling:** If initcode *does* run but fails to return deployment bytecode (or returns empty/errors), this would also lead to creation failure.
      4.  Address calculation logic itself is likely *not* the primary issue now, given the previous report, but cannot be fully verified until initcode executes.
    </hypothesis>
    <logging_suggestions>
      In `src/evm/opcodes/system.zig`, within `op_create` and `op_create2` functions, specifically around the sub-execution of initcode:
      ```zig
      // ... before attempting to execute init_code ...
      std.debug.print("CREATE/2: Attempting initcode execution. Init Code length: {d}
", .{init_code.len});
      std.debug.print("CREATE/2: Gas for initcode execution (after 63/64 rule): {d}
", .{gas_for_sub_creation});
      std.debug.print("CREATE/2: Current frame gas before sub-call: {d}
", .{frame.gas_remaining});

      // ... after the internal call to execute init_code ...
      std.debug.print("CREATE/2: Initcode execution result (success_flag: {any}, gas_returned: {d}, output_len: {d})
", .{initcode_success_flag, gas_returned_from_initcode, output_bytecode.len});
      std.debug.print("CREATE/2: Newly computed address (if successful): {any}
", .{newly_created_address});
      std.debug.print("CREATE/2: Frame gas remaining after all: {d}
", .{frame.gas_remaining});
      ```
      In the VM's sub-call/initcode execution logic:
      ```zig
      std.debug.print("Sub-call/Initcode: Entry with gas: {d}
", .{initial_gas_for_sub_call});
      // ... after sub-call execution ...
      std.debug.print("Sub-call/Initcode: Exiting. Gas remaining in sub-call: {d}, Execution status: {any}
", .{gas_left_in_sub_call, status_of_sub_call});
      ```
    </logging_suggestions>
    <fix_strategy>
      1.  **Implement/Verify Initcode Sub-Execution:**
          *   Ensure `op_create`/`op_create2` correctly set up and execute a new frame or sub-context for the `init_code`.
          *   Verify that the `gas_for_sub_creation` is correctly passed to this new execution context. Apply the EIP-150 63/64th rule for gas forwarding.
          *   The sub-execution must run the `init_code` as bytecode.
      2.  **Handle Initcode Return:**
          *   The bytecode returned by the successful execution of `init_code` is the actual deployment bytecode for the new contract. This must be captured.
          *   If `init_code` reverts or runs out of gas, the creation fails, and `0` should be pushed to the stack. All gas provided to the sub-call (except for refunds) is consumed.
          *   If successful, the deployment bytecode's size must be checked against `MAX_CODE_SIZE` (EIP-170) and an additional gas cost per byte of deployed code must be charged.
      3.  **State Changes:**
          *   If successful, the new account is created with the deployment bytecode, nonce is set, and balance is transferred.
          *   If value is transferred, ensure sender has enough balance and that balance is correctly moved.
      4.  **Gas Accounting:** Ensure gas consumed by the initcode execution is correctly subtracted from the calling frame's gas (after adding back the 63/64th unspent portion).
      5.  **REVM Reference**: `revm/crates/interpreter/src/interpreter_action.rs` (functions `create` and `create2`) and how it calls `frame_execute_raw`.

    *   **Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE

    *   **Report (Previous):**
        *   **Fix:** Implemented centralized error_mapping module and updated all opcode files to properly map memory errors instead of generic OutOfOffset

    <failure_summary>
      General error mapping seems improved. Many previous `OutOfOffset` failures for CALL/DELEGATECALL/STATICCALL are resolved.
      **Remaining Issue:** Test `environment_system_test.test.Integration: Call with value transfer` fails.
      - Log shows `memory.zig:216:9 (ensure_context_capacity)` returning `MemoryError.MemoryLimitExceeded`.
      - This is then passed to `error_mapping.zig:20:5 (map_memory_error)`.
      - The test `expected true` for the condition `err == helpers.ExecutionError.Error.OutOfGas` but found `false`.
      - This implies that `map_memory_error(MemoryError.MemoryLimitExceeded)` is *not* returning `ExecutionError.Error.OutOfGas`.
    </failure_summary>
    <hypothesis>
      1.  **Incorrect Error Mapping for `MemoryLimitExceeded`**: The function `map_memory_error` in `src/evm/error_mapping.zig` does not correctly map `MemoryError.MemoryLimitExceeded` to `ExecutionError.Error.OutOfGas`.
      2.  **Underlying Memory Issue (Less Likely for this specific test failure mode)**: While the error mapping is the immediate problem for the test assertion, the `MemoryLimitExceeded` itself could still be due to incorrect `args_offset`, `args_size` calculation or logic in `memory.zig` for the "Call with value transfer" scenario specifically. However, the test failure is about the *expected error type*.
    </hypothesis>

      ```
    </logging_suggestions>
    <fix_strategy>
      1.  **Correct `map_memory_error`**:
          *   In `src/evm/error_mapping.zig`, ensure that `MemoryError.MemoryLimitExceeded` is explicitly mapped to `ExecutionError.Error.OutOfGas`.
          ```zig
          // In src/evm/error_mapping.zig
          pub fn map_memory_error(err: Memory.MemoryError) ExecutionError.Error {
              return switch (err) {
                  // ...
                  Memory.MemoryError.MemoryLimitExceeded => ExecutionError.Error.OutOfGas, // Primary Fix
                  // ...
                  else => ExecutionError.Error.OutOfOffset, // Fallback for unmapped memory errors
              };
          }
          ```
      2.  **Verify Test Logic**: After fixing the mapping, if `environment_system_test.test.Integration: Call with value transfer` *still* fails but with a different error or an unexpected success, then investigate the memory argument calculations (`args_offset`, `args_size`) within `op_call` for that specific test case to see why `MemoryLimitExceeded` was triggered in the first place.

      Tests `system_test.test.CREATE: EIP-3860 initcode size limit` and `system_test.test.CREATE2: EIP-3860 initcode size limit` fail.
      They expect an `error.MaxCodeSizeExceeded` but the opcodes succeed, returning an `operation.ExecutionResult`. This means the initcode size check (EIP-3860, active since Shanghai) is not being enforced.

      **NEW REGRESSION:** `control_flow_test.test.Integration: Conditional jump patterns` now also fails with `ExecutionError.Error.InvalidJump` from `control.zig:63:13`.
      This indicates the jump destination was invalid. The stack order fix for JUMPI was insufficient or unrelated to this specific error.
    </failure_summary>
    <hypothesis>
      1.  **Incorrect `valid_jumpdest` Logic**: The `frame.contract.valid_jumpdest(target_usize)` check within `op_jumpi` (and `op_jump`) is incorrectly determining the validity of the jump destination.
      2.  **Flawed `CodeAnalysis`**: The `CodeAnalysis` module (in `src/evm/code_analysis.zig` or similar) is not correctly identifying or storing `JUMPDEST` (0x5b) locations, or it's failing to distinguish `JUMPDEST` opcodes from data bytes within `PUSH` instructions (i.e., not using the `code_segments` bitmap correctly).
      3.  The test bytecode or target destination might be genuinely invalid in one of the failing tests, but the EVM should handle it gracefully (as `InvalidJump`). The issue is that it might be expected to be valid by the test, or a previously passing test now fails.

              b. `frame.contract.code[target_usize] == 0x5b` (JUMPDEST opcode).
              c. The byte at `target_usize` must be part of a genuine opcode, not PUSHdata. This requires a correctly generated `code_segments` bitmap from `CodeAnalysis` that accurately marks data bytes.

      3.  **Examine Test Bytecode**: For both failing tests, manually inspect the bytecode and the target jump destinations. Verify if they *should* be valid according_to_spec and the `code_segments` logic.
      4.  **Operand Order for JUMPI**: Double-check that `dest` and `condition` are popped in the correct order as per EVM spec (destination first, then condition). The previous fix report mentioned this, but it's worth re-verifying given the persistent failure.

    <failure_summary>
      Test `control_test.test.Control: SELFDESTRUCT basic operation` fails on gas expectation: `expected 2600, found 7600`.
      The Zig EVM correctly found 7600 gas consumed. The `JumpTable` log is `Opcode 0xff (SELFDESTRUCT), initial frame gas: 10000, const_gas = 5000, gas after const_consume: 5000, gas after op_execute: 2400`. This means `10000 - 2400 = 7600` gas was used.
      The error points to `control_test.zig:349:5`, which is `try helpers.expectGasUsed(test_frame.frame, 10000, helpers.opcodes.gas_constants.ColdAccountAccessCost);`.
    </failure_summary>
    <hypothesis>
      The Zig EVM's gas calculation for `SELFDESTRUCT` (0xff) is likely correct. The test's expectation is incorrect.
      - `SELFDESTRUCT` base cost (since Tangerine Whistle) is 5000 gas.
      - If the beneficiary is a cold account (since Berlin), an additional `COLD_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_COST` (2600 gas) is charged.
      - Total for a cold beneficiary: `5000 + 2600 = 7600` gas.
      The test expects only the `COLD_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_COST`.
    </hypothesis>

      Minimal EVM code logging needed. Confirm the conditions in the test:

      // Assuming 'vm.access_list.is_cold(beneficiary_address)' or similar check:

    <failure_summary>
      Several memory operation tests are now passing after stack order corrections.
      **Remaining Issue:** Test `memory_storage_test.test.Integration: Memory expansion tracking` (MSIZE) **still fails**.
      - Output: `expected 201, found 224` after an `MSTORE8` to offset 200.
      - Gas log for the MSTORE8: `MSTORE8: offset=200, value=170`. `gas_after_op_execute: 9964` (consumed 9 gas).
      - This 9 gas implies memory expansion was calculated based on word boundaries (e.g., to 224 or 256 bytes for gas purposes).
      - However, MSIZE should return the *highest byte accessed + 1*, which would be 201 if byte 200 was written.
    </failure_summary>
    <hypothesis>
      The `MSIZE` failure is likely due to the memory module (e.g., `arena_memory.zig` or `memory.zig`) updating its internal "active size" or "context size" to the word-aligned physical buffer size after an expansion, rather than the logical highest byte accessed + 1.
      - Specifically, `Memory.resize_context` or `Memory.ensure_context_capacity` might be setting `ctx.size` (or equivalent) to the new *physical* size (e.g., 224 or 256) instead of the requested *logical* size (e.g., 201).
      - `MSIZE` then returns this physical size.
      The stack order for MSTORE/MLOAD/MSTORE8/MCOPY is likely correct now for the passing tests.
    </hypothesis>

    </logging_suggestions>
    <fix_strategy>
      1.  **Modify Memory Module (`memory.zig` or `arena_memory.zig`):**
          *   The primary function responsible for resizing memory (e.g., `resize_context`) needs to distinguish between the *logical size* (highest byte accessed + 1) and the *physical size* (word-aligned buffer size).
          *   It should update the context's `size` field (or an equivalent like `logical_size`) to reflect the actual highest byte accessed + 1.
          *   The physical buffer can still be expanded to word boundaries for gas calculation efficiency, but `MSIZE` must return the logical size.
      2.  **Review `MSIZE` Opcode**: Ensure `op_msize` in `src/evm/opcodes/memory.zig` correctly calls `frame.memory.context_size()` (or the new logical size method).
      3.  **Gas Calculation vs. MSIZE**: Gas calculation for memory expansion *should* use the word-aligned size. `MSIZE` should report the highest active byte. These two concepts need to be distinct in the memory module.

      - For `LT (0x10)`: `s[0] = val1`, `s[1] = val2`. Opcode pops `s[1]` (val2) then `s[0]` (val1). It should compute `s[0] < s[1]`. If the implementation pops `a=stack.pop()` then `b=stack.pop()`, it gets `a=val2, b=val1`. The comparison should be `b < a`. It's likely doing `a < b` (i.e., `val2 < val1`).
      - For `GT (0x11)`: Similar issue. It should compute `s[0] > s[1]`. If `a=val2, b=val1`, it should be `b > a`.
