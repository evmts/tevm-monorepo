Memory tests fixed:
- Fixed stack order for MSTORE (offset on top, value second)
- Fixed stack order for MSTORE8 (offset on top, value second)  
- Fixed stack order for MCOPY (size on top, src second, dest third)
- All memory tests now pass correctly

This was a major fix that resolved many test failures
