Gas consumption fixes completed:

1. Fixed LOG0 gas consumption test expectation:
   - Memory expansion from 0 to 32 bytes = 3 gas (not 6)
   - Formula: 3*words + words²/512
   - For 1 word: 3*1 + 1²/512 = 3

2. Fixed LOG4 gas consumption test expectation:
   - Base: 375
   - Topics: 4 * 375 = 1500  
   - Data: 10 * 8 = 80
   - Memory expansion: 3 gas (10 bytes rounds to 1 word)
   - Total: 1958 gas (not 1910)

All 401 opcode tests now pass!

Tests improved from 672/719 to 705/719 total passing.
