# Test Compilation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. pushStack API Changes
- Changed from `pushStack(value)` to `pushStack(&[_]u256{value})`
- The pushStack function now expects an array of u256 values instead of a single value

### 2. Memory API Changes
- Changed from `memory.set_slice()` to `memory.set_data()`
- Fixed array pointer issues by using slice syntax: `array[0..]` instead of `&array`

### 3. Address.to_u256 Changes
- Changed direct calls to `Address.to_u256()` to use the helper function `helpers.toU256()`
- Fixed array arguments to Address conversion functions

### 4. VM Mock Result Fields
- Changed `test_vm.vm.create_contract_result` to `test_vm.create_result`
- Changed `test_vm.vm.call_contract_result` to `test_vm.call_result`
- Added `test_vm.syncMocks()` calls after setting mock results

### 5. Chain Rules Fields
- Changed `IsEIP2929` to `IsBerlin` (EIP-2929 is part of Berlin hardfork)
- Changed `IsEIP2200` to `IsConstantinople` (EIP-2200 is part of Constantinople)

### 6. Gas Refund Field Location
- Changed `test_frame.frame.gas_refund` to `test_frame.frame.contract.gas_refund`
- Gas refund is tracked in the Contract struct, not the Frame

### 7. For Loop Compilation Issues
- Added `inline` keyword to for loops iterating over comptime-known structs with function pointers
- Fixed array iteration patterns to use separate const declarations

### 8. Integer Literal Overflow
- Fixed hex literal that was too large for u256 type by adjusting the value

### 9. Error Union Comparisons
- Changed error union comparisons from `result == .{}` to `_ = try result`

All compilation errors have been resolved. The tests now compile successfully, though some tests are failing due to logic issues that need separate attention.
