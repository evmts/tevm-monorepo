# Krome - Native Blockchain Apps Made Simple

Build blazingly fast, tiny blockchain applications that run natively on all major desktop and mobile platforms.

## What is Krome?

Krome is a framework for building blockchain applications that compile to tiny, native binaries for all major platforms. By leveraging Rust and advanced optimizations, Krome apps are typically under 10MB in size while delivering unmatched performance. It combines the best of modern development tools and frameworks:

- **[Tauri](https://tauri.app)** for secure native cross-platform applications
- **[Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev)** for performant, intuitive UI development
- **[TEVM](https://tevm.sh)** for Ethereum Virtual Machine integration
- **[Deno (TODO)](https://deno.land)** for secure JavaScript runtime
- **[Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios)** (optional) for trustless light client capabilities

What sets Krome apart is its uncompromising focus on both user experience and developer productivity. Through its opinionated framework, it delivers a polished, native feel for users while maximizing development speed and maintainability for developers.

## Quick Start

Run app in dev mode

```bash
pnpm install

tauri dev
```

See [tauri 2.0](https://v2.tauri.app/) docs for tauri specific information

## File structure

App logic

- [src/](./src/) contains the source code for the svelte app
- Svelte uses file based routing in [src/routes](./src/routes/) folder
- Context to help your llm write svelte is in [src/svelte.llm.txt](./src/svelte.llm.txt)
- [src-tauri](./src-tauri) contains the rust code
- Rust code is binded to svelte app in [src-tauri/lib.rs](./src-tauri/lib.rs)

Tauri specific files

- [src-tauri/](./src-tauri/tauri.conf.json) contains the [tauri config](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/config/)
- Additional configuration is in the capabilities file [src-tauri/capabilities](./src-tauri/capabilities/)
