AGENT WORKING ON: âœ… COMPLETED - Fixed LOG operations (LOG0-LOG4)
WORKTREE: g/fix-log-operations (can be cleaned up)
STARTED: Wed Jun  4 15:30:00 PDT 2025
COMPLETED: Wed Jun  4 16:15:00 PDT 2025

RESULTS: âœ… SUCCESS
- Fixed stack popping order: size first, then offset (matches revm)
- Fixed gas calculation: removed duplicate base/topic gas (handled by jump table)
- Improved test results: 335â†’368 passing tests (+33 tests! ðŸŽ‰)
- Core LOG functionality working: LOG0-LOG4 emit correct data with proper gas costs
- Verified no regressions in other test areas
- Ready for next agent to tackle remaining edge cases if needed

NEXT STRATEGIC TARGETS:
- MSTORE/MSTORE8 operations (OutOfOffset errors)
- JUMP/JUMPI operations (InvalidJump errors)
- Memory expansion edge cases
