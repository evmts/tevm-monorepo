# Primitives

This crate is a core component of the Revm system. It is designed to provide definitions for a range of types and structures commonly used throughout the application. It is set up to be compatible with environments that do not include Rust's standard library, as indicated by the `no_std` attribute.

Modules:

- [bits](./primitives/bits.md): This module provides types for handling specific sizes of byte arrays (B160 and B256).
- [bytecode](./primitives/bytecode.md): This module provides functionality related to EVM bytecode.
- [constants](./primitives/constants.md): This module contains constant values used throughout the EVM implementation.
- [db](./primitives/database.md): This module contains data structures and functions related to the EVM's database implementation.
- [env](./primitives/environment.md): This module contains types and functions related to the EVM's environment, including block headers, and environment values.
- [log](./primitives/log.md): This module provides types and functionality for Ethereum logs.
- [precompile](./primitives/precompile.md): This module contains types related to Ethereum's precompiled contracts.
- [result](./primitives/result.md): This module provides types for representing execution results and errors in the EVM.
- [specification](./primitives/specifications.md): This module defines types related to Ethereum specifications (also known as hard forks).
- [state](./primitives/state.md): This module provides types and functions for managing Ethereum state, including accounts and storage.
- [utilities](./primitives/utils.md): This module provides utility functions used in multiple places across the EVM implementation.

External Crates:

- alloc: The alloc crate provides types for heap allocation.
- bitvec: The bitvec crate provides a data structure to handle sequences of bits.
- bytes: The bytes crate provides utilities for working with bytes.
- hex: The hex crate provides utilities for encoding and decoding hexadecimal.
- hex_literal: The hex_literal crate provides a macro for including hexadecimal data directly in the source code.
- hashbrown: The hashbrown crate provides high-performance hash map and hash set data structures.
- ruint: The ruint crate provides types and functions for big unsigned integer arithmetic.

Type Aliases:

- Address: An alias for B160, representing a 20-byte Ethereum address.
- Hash: An alias for B256, typically used to represent 256-bit hashes or integer values in Ethereum.

Re-exported Types:

- B160: A type representing a 160-bit (or 20-byte) array, typically used for Ethereum addresses.
- B256: A type representing a 256-bit (or 32-byte) array, typically used for Ethereum hashes or integers.
- Bytes: A type representing a sequence of bytes.
- U256: A 256-bit unsigned integer type from the ruint crate.
- HashMap and HashSet: High-performance hash map and hash set data structures from the hashbrown crate.

Re-exported Modules:
All types, constants, and functions from the `bytecode`, `constants`, `env`, `log`, `precompile`, `result`, `specification`, `state`, and `utilities` modules are re-exported, allowing users to import these items directly from the `primitives` crate.
