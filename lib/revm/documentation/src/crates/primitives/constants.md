# Constants

Holds constant values used throughout the system. This module defines important constants that help limit and manage resources in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The constants include `STACK_LIMIT` and `CALL_STACK_LIMIT`, which restrict the size of the interpreter stack and the EVM call stack, respectively. Both are set to 1024.

The module also defines `MAX_CODE_SIZE`, which is set according to [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170)'s specification. [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170) imposes a maximum limit on the contract code size to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in Ethereum. Without this cap, the act of calling a contract can trigger costly operations that scale with the size of the contract's code. These operations include reading the code from disk, preprocessing the code for VM execution, and adding data to the block's proof-of-validity. By implementing `MAX_CODE_SIZE` (set to `0x6000` or ~25kb), the EVM ensures that the cost of these operations remains manageable, even under high gas levels that could be encountered in the future. [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170)'s implementation thus offers crucial protection against potential DoS attacks and maintains efficiency, especially for future light clients verifying proofs of validity or invalidity.

Another constant defined here is `MAX_INITCODE_SIZE`, set in accordance with [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860). [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860) extends EIP-170 by introducing a maximum size limit for initialization code (initcode) and enforcing a gas charge for every 32-byte chunk of initcode, to account for the cost of jump destination analysis. Before [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860), initcode analysis during contract creation wasn't metered, nor was there an upper limit for its size, resulting in potential inefficiencies and vulnerabilities. By setting `MAX_INITCODE_SIZE` to 2 \* `MAX_CODE_SIZE` and introducing the said gas charge, [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860) ensures that the cost of initcode analysis scales proportionately with its size. This constant, therefore, facilitates fair charging, simplifies EVM engines by setting explicit limits, and helps to create an extendable cost system for the future.
