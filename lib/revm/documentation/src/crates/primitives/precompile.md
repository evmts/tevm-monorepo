# precompile

This module implements precompiled contracts in the EVM, adding a layer of pre-set functionalities. These are documented in more detail in the next section. The module defines the types and the enum that are used to handle precompiled contracts.

`PrecompileResult`: This is a type alias for a `Result` type. The `Ok` variant of this type contains a tuple (`u64`, `Vec<u8>`), where the `u64` integer likely represents gas used by the precompiled contract, and the `Vec<u8>` holds the output data. The Err variant contains a PrecompileError.

`StandardPrecompileFn` and `CustomPrecompileFn`: These are type aliases for function pointers. Both functions take a byte slice and a `u64` (probably the available gas) as arguments and return a `PrecompileResult`. The naming suggests that the former refers to built-in precompiled contracts, while the latter may refer to custom, user-defined contracts.

`PrecompileError`: This is an enumeration (enum) which describes the different types of errors that could occur while executing a precompiled contract. The listed variants suggest these errors are related to gas consumption, `Blake2` hash function, modular exponentiation ("`Modexp`"), and `Bn128`, which is a specific elliptic curve used in cryptography.
