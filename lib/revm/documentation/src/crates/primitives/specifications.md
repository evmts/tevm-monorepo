# Specifications

Holds data related to Ethereum's technical specifications, serving as a reference point for Ethereum's rules and procedures obtained from the [Ethereum execution specifications](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs). The module is primarily used to enumerate and handle Ethereum's network upgrades or "hard forks" within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). These hard forks are referred to as `SpecId` in the code, representing different phases of Ethereum's development.

The `SpecId` enum assigns a unique numerical value and a unique string identifier to each Ethereum hard fork. These upgrades range from the earliest ones such as `FRONTIER` and `HOMESTEAD`, through to the most recent ones, including `LONDON`, `MERGE`, `SHANGHAI`, and `LATEST`.

The code also includes conversion methods such as `try_from_u8()` and `from()`. The former attempts to create a `SpecId` from a given u8 integer, while the latter creates a `SpecId` based on a string representing the name of the hard fork.

The `enabled()` method in `SpecId` is used to check if one spec is enabled on another, considering the order in which the hard forks were enacted.

The `Spec` trait is used to abstract the process of checking whether a given spec is enabled. It only has one method, `enabled()`, and a constant `SPEC_ID`.

The module then defines various `Spec` structs, each representing a different hard fork. These structs implement the `Spec` trait and each struct's `SPEC_ID` corresponds to the correct `SpecId` variant.

This module provides the necessary framework to handle and interact with the different Ethereum hard forks within the EVM, making it possible to handle transactions and contracts differently depending on which hard fork rules apply. It also simplifies the process of adapting to future hard forks by creating a new `SpecId` and corresponding `Spec` struct.
