# Bytecode

This module defines structures and methods to manipulate Ethereum bytecode and manage its state. It's built around three main components: `JumpMap`, `BytecodeState`, and `Bytecode`.

The `JumpMap` structure stores a map of valid `jump` destinations within a given Ethereum bytecode sequence. It is essentially an `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counter) wrapping a `BitVec` (bit vector), which can be accessed and modified using the defined methods, such as `as_slice()`, `from_slice()`, and `is_valid()`.

The `BytecodeState` is an enumeration, capturing the three possible states of the bytecode: `Raw`, `Checked`, and `Analysed`. In the `Checked` and `Analysed` states, additional data is provided, such as the length of the bytecode and, in the `Analysed` state, a `JumpMap`.

The `Bytecode` struct holds the actual bytecode, its hash, and its current state (`BytecodeState`). It provides several methods to interact with the bytecode, such as getting the length of the bytecode, checking if it's empty, retrieving its state, and converting the bytecode to a checked state. It also provides methods to create new instances of the `Bytecode` struct in different states.
