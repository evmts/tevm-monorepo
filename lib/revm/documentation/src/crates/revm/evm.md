# EVM Module Documentation

This document provides the documentation for the `EVM` module.

## The `EVM`

The primary struct in this module is `EVM`. The EVM struct is generic over a type DB. This means that when you use the EVM struct, you can specify the type that DB should represent. It adds flexibility to the struct, allowing it to store different types of databases or data structures in the db field depending on the use case. The `EVM` struct enables `transact` to update the state directly to the database. Additionally, it allows the user to set all environment parameters.

The parameters that can be set are divided between `Config`, `Block`, and `Transaction` (tx). For transacting on the EVM, you can call `transact_commit` that will automatically apply changes to the database.

## Database Abstractions

You can implement the traits Database, DatabaseRef or Database + DatabaseCommit depending on the desired handling of the struct.

- `Database`: Has mutable `self` in its functions. It's useful if you want to modify your cache or update some statistics on `get` calls. This trait enables `preverify_transaction`, `transact_preverified`, `transact` and `inspect` functions.
- `DatabaseRef`: Takes a reference on the object, this is useful if you only have a reference on the state and don't want to update anything on it. It enables `previerify_transaction`, `transact_preverified_ref`, `transact_ref` and `inspect_ref` functions.
- `Database + DatabaseCommit`: Allows directly committing changes of a transaction. It enables `transact_commit` and `inspect_commit` functions.
