# EVM Implementation

This module implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a stack-based virtual machine that executes Ethereum smart contracts. The following methods are exposed through the `EVMImpl` struct.

## Methods

- `run_interpreter`

    This method is responsible for setting up and running the interpreter for a specific contract.

    - `contract`: A `Contract` instance that the interpreter will execute.
    - `gas_limit`: A `u64` that determines the maximum amount of gas that the execution can consume.
    - `is_static`: A boolean flag indicating if the execution is static. Static executions cannot modify the state.

    The method returns a tuple containing the result of the execution and the interpreter instance. The result is an `InstructionResult` enumeration value that indicates if the execution was successful or if an error occurred.

    This creates a contract with a specific bytecode and a gas price, then runs the interpreter on this contract with a specified gas limit. The is_static flag is set to false which means the execution can modify the state. The stack machine implements the following instructions:

- `call_precompile`

    This method handles the execution of precompiled contracts. These are a special set of contracts that are part of the Ethereum protocol and implemented in native code for efficiency.

    - `gas`: A `Gas` instance representing the amount of gas available for execution.
    - `contract`: The address of the precompiled contract in the form of a `B160` instance.
    - `input_data`: The input data for the contract as a `Bytes` instance.

    The method returns a tuple containing the result of the contract execution, the remaining gas, and any output data as a `Bytes` instance. 

- `call_inner`

    This method performs a contract call within the EVM.

    - `inputs`: A mutable reference to a `CallInputs` instance, which contains all the necessary information for the contract call.

    The method returns a tuple containing the result of the call (as an `InstructionResult`), the remaining gas (as a `Gas` instance), and any output data from the call (as a `Bytes` instance).
