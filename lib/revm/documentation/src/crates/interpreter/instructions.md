# The `instruction.rs` Module in the Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The `instruction.rs` module defines interpretation mappings for EVM bytecode. It provides the definition of the `Instruction` struct, as well as the `Opcode` enumeration and the `execute` function, which runs a specific instruction.

## `Opcode` Enum

The `Opcode` enum represents the opcodes that are available in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each variant corresponds to an operation that can be performed, such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, jumps, and memory operations.

## `Instruction` Struct

The `Instruction` struct represents a single instruction in the EVM. It contains the opcode, which is the operation to be performed, and a list of bytes representing the operands for the instruction.

## `execute` Function

The `execute` function interprets an instruction. It uses the opcode to determine what operation to perform and then performs the operation using the operands in the instruction.
