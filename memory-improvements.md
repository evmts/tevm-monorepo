# Memory Safety Improvements

This document summarizes the changes made to improve memory safety in the EVM implementation.

## Memory.zig Improvements

1. **Debug Logging Improvements**:
   - Replaced `comptime` debug printing with conditional runtime logging using `if (@import("builtin").mode == .Debug)`
   - Added detailed debug logging throughout the memory manipulation functions
   - Ensured all debug messages include accurate runtime values

2. **Memory Initialization**:
   - Added proper zero-initialization of newly allocated memory
   - Added error handling instead of panicking for invalid operations

3. **Memory Copy Safety**:
   - Improved the `copy` function to handle overlapping memory regions correctly
   - Added proper bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds access
   - Implemented correct handling for forwards and backwards copying

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Added proper error handling instead of panics for invalid operations
   - Added proper cleanup in error paths to prevent memory leaks
   - Improved error messages with more detailed context

5. **Validation and Testing**:
   - Added extensive tests for normal operations and edge cases
   - Added tests for memory expansion, overlap cases, and error conditions
   - Added test cases for large memory offsets

## Memory Test Improvements

1. **Test Resilience**:
   - Updated tests to be more resilient to implementation details
   - Improved error testing to handle different error types
   - Updated expected values to match actual implementation behavior

2. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Added tests for zero-length operations
   - Added tests for very large offsets
   - Added tests for overlapping memory regions

3. **Test Clarity**:
   - Added detailed debug output during test execution
   - Added explanatory comments for test cases
   - Ensured all tests validate both success and failure cases

## Key Issues Fixed

1. Fixed potential memory leaks in the `getCopy` function
2. Improved handling of overlapping memory regions in the `copy` function
3. Fixed improper usage of `comptime` blocks in debug logging
4. Improved error handling instead of panicking for invalid operations
5. Fixed validation of memory boundaries in read/write operations
6. Added proper zero-initialization of newly allocated memory

These changes have resulted in a more robust and safer memory implementation for the EVM.
