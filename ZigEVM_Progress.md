# ZigEVM Implementation Progress

## Completed Components

We've started implementing the core components for the ZigEVM:

### 1. Core Types and Structures
- Defined fundamental types (U256, Address, Hash)
- Implemented error handling
- Created execution result types

### 2. Memory Management
- Implemented efficient memory model
- Support for memory expansion with proper gas calculation
- Memory operations (store, load, copy)

### 3. Stack Operations
- Implemented EVM stack with 1024 element limit
- Support for push, pop, peek operations
- DUP and SWAP operations for all positions

### 4. Opcode Definitions
- Defined all EVM opcodes as an enum
- Added metadata for each opcode (gas cost, stack impacts)
- Support for both legacy and newer opcodes from recent hard forks

### 5. Instruction Implementations
- Arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV)
- Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
- Memory operations (MLOAD, MSTORE, MSTORE8, MSIZE)
- Flow control operations (PUSH, DUP, SWAP, JUMP, JUMPI)
- Halting operations (STOP, RETURN, REVERT)

### 6. Execution Engine
- Main execution loop that processes bytecode
- Jump destination validation
- Error handling and gas accounting
- Support for return data handling

### 7. Testing Framework
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for simple contract execution
- Gas accounting verification

## Components Still To Be Implemented

### 1. State Management
- Account state structure
- Storage operations (SLOAD, SSTORE)
- World state management

### 2. Call Frame Management
- Support for nested calls (CALL, DELEGATECALL, STATICCALL)
- Call context isolation and data sharing
- Call depth tracking

### 3. Contract Creation
- CREATE and CREATE2 operations
- Code deployment logic

### 4. Precompiled Contracts
- Standard Ethereum precompiles (ecrecover, sha256, etc.)
- Gas cost calculations for precompiles

### 5. Advanced Features
- Transaction execution
- Fork support for different EVM versions
- EOF support
- EIP-1559, EIP-4844 support

### 6. WebAssembly Integration
- WASM exports for key operations
- Memory management between JS and WASM
- Efficient data transfer

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- Bytecode analysis for gas and execution optimization
- SIMD optimizations for common operations

## Next Steps

1. Implement storage operations (SLOAD, SSTORE)
2. Add more complex opcode implementations (CALL, CREATE, etc.)
3. Implement state management interface
4. Create better testing infrastructure with Ethereum test vectors
5. Add WebAssembly integration for JavaScript environments

These steps will allow us to move toward a complete EVM implementation in Zig that can be used both natively and via WebAssembly in browsers.
