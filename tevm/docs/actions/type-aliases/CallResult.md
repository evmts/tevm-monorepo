> **CallResult**\<`ErrorType`\> = `object`

Defined in: packages/actions/types/Call/CallResult.d.ts:30

Result of a TEVM VM Call method.

## Example

```typescript
import { createClient } from 'viem'
import { createTevmTransport, tevmCall } from 'tevm'

import { CallResult } from 'tevm/actions'

const client = createClient({
  transport: createTevmTransport({}),
  chain: optimism,
})

const callParams = {
  data: '0x...',
  bytecode: '0x...',
  gasLimit: 420n,
}

const result: CallResult = await tevmCall(client, callParams)
console.log(result)
```
