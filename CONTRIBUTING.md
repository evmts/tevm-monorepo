## Contributing to Tevm

## Quick start

1. Install pnpm for installing node_modules

```bash
npm i pnpm --global && pnpm --version
```

2. Install bun

```bash
npm i bun --global && bun --version
```

or run bun update if already installed

```bash
bun update
```

3. Update submodules

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

4. Run everything

`bun allz` will run everything

`bun all` will run a smaller subset of everything

```bash
bun allz
```

This includes
- linting package.json
- linting npm build
- linting unused deps
- linting source code
- generated docs
- building all .d.ts types for all packages
- building all cjs for all packages
- running all tests
- running all dev fixtures

3. Understand the repo in [monorepo section](#monorepo) and [packages](#packages) sections

## Monorepo

Tevm is a monorepo using

- [nx](https://nx.dev/concepts/mental-model) for caching and task management
- [bun](https://bun.sh/docs) for script runner and workspace node_module management
- [changesets](./.changeset/) for package versioning

For a list of all packages, see the `workspaces` key in the root level [package.json](./package.json)

## Packages

Tevm is heavily broken up into small packages. To see the entire package graph use nx

```bash
bun run nx graph
```

For more information the [reference docs](https://tevm.sh) are a useful resource. They are generated from the source code and link back to it

#### Build packages

- [@tevm/bundler](./bundlers/bundler) is the main bundler used to create all the build tools. It bundles all contract imports using [@tevm/solc](./solc) for it's solidity compiler and [@tevm/runtime](./runtime) to construct runtimes.
- [@tevm/ts-plugin](./ts-plugin) is the LSP (language service protocol) plugin. It is what allows code editors such as VSCode to correctly infer types of solidity imports.
- [bundlers/*](./bundlers) Are where all the supported bundlers live. Most are created using [@tevm/unplugin](./bundlers/unplugin) which implements a rollup plugin once to be reused in many packages including [@tevm/webpack](./bundlers/webpack) and [@tevm/vite](./bundlers/vite) and more.
- [@tevm/config](./config) is the package that loads the Tevm config

#### Runtime packages

- [@tevm/contract](./core) is the main entry point for all runtime functionality.

#### Docs

- [@tevm/docs](./docs) is the [vitepress docs site](https://tevm.sh). Its reference docs are generated via `bun generate:docs`

#### Example apps

Example apps are in [/examples/*](./examples). [@tevm/example-esbuild](./examples/esbuild) has a vitest test and is the simplist app.

## Code best practices

#### JavaScript with jsdoc

`@tevm` is written in javascript with jsdoc so its `esm` build does not need to be built. This means any user using modern `esm` will be using the same src code in their node_modules as what is here.

This means all tevm packages run without being built by default and the same src code is shipped to most users

- [src/index.js](./src/index.js) - the entrypoint to the package

**Note** there is still 100% typesafety. TypeScript is able to typecheck via setting `checkJs: true` in the tsconfig and using jsdoc.

#### Types

The types are built to cache their result for end users.

```
bun build:types
```

- [tsconfig](./tsconfig.json) - @tevm/config tsconfig
- [@tevm/tsconfig](../tsconfig/base.json) - base tsconfig inherited from

## Running tests

```
bun run test
```

`@tevm/config` has >99% test coverage. Run the tests with `bun run test`

Note `bun test` will run bun instead of [vitest](https://vitest.dev) resulting in errors


## Fixtures

Fixtures in [src/fixtures](./src/fixtures/) exist both for the vitest tests and also can be loaded in watch mode.

The best way to debug a bug or implement a new feature is to first add a new fixture to use in test or dev server

Some fixtures are expected to error and the dev server will succeed if they do error. Which fixtures should error is configured in [scripts/runFixture.ts](./scripts/runFixture.ts)

Fixtures run with debug logging turned on. Debug logging is added to every function along with strong error handling so most debugging tasks won't need to involve adding console.logs if you are using a fixture.

#### Running all fixtures

```bash
bun dev
```

#### Running a specific fixtures

```bash
bun fixture basic
```
Valid names include any of the folder names in [src/fixtures](./fixtures). The default is basic

#### Adding a fixture

1. `cp -r src/fixtures/basic src/fixtures/myNewFixture`
2. update your fixture
3. Load your fixture `bun fixture myNewFixture`

Now you can implement your feature or use your fixture to write a test.

## Running linter

By default the linter runs in --fix mode

```basy
bun lint && bun format
```

The linter used is biome not prettier or eslint

#### Generating docs

Docs are generated in the `docs` folder of every package as well as the [main docs site](./docs)

```
bun generate:docs
```

Docs are generated based on the jsdoc and type errors

#### Barrel files

Whenever a new API is added, you will need to update a lot of barrel files. Though tedious this helps keep the packages stable from accidental breaking changes or exporting something that should be private. You will need to update the following places:

- All the `index.js` in your package
- Possibly the top level `src/index.ts` to update the types too if
- Update the [tevm](./tevm) package (unless it's a build tool change)
- Update the [@tevm/bundler](./bundler/) package if it's a build tool api

If you add a lot of files, there is a tool to automatically generate a barrel file in your folder in [`scripts`](./scripts/createBarrelFiles.ts)

## Clean build

If you ever have a `wtf` moment, consider doing a clean build. It will remove node_modules and then rebuild repo from scratch

```
pnpm all:clean
```
