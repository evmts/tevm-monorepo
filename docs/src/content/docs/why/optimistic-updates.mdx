# Implementing Robust Optimistic UI

## Problem

I want a robust way of updating my UI optimistically for optimal ux.

## Solution

Use Tevm to simulate putting the EVM in an optimistic state

## Example

Let's say we are making an onchain game and my contract has a `movePlayer(direction)` method.

```typescript
import { createClient, http, walletActions, publicActions } from 'viem'
import { redstone } from 'viem/chains'
import { GameContract } from '../contracts'
import {account} from './account.js'

const client = createClient({
  account,
  chain: redstone,
  transport: http()
}).extend(walletActions).extend(publicActions)

const hash = await client.writeContract({
  address: GameContract.address,
  abi: GameContract.abi,
  functionName: 'movePlayer',
  args: [direction],
})

await client.waitForReceipt({hash})

const newPosition = await client.readContract({
  address: GameContract.address,
  abi: GameContract.abi,
  functionName: 'getPlayerPosition',
  args: [],
})

renderNewPosition(newPosition)
```

The problem with this code is we will have to both wait for the tx hash to come back in the writeContract and then also wait for the receipt before rendering the new player.

Now we could keep track of state ourselves. But this gets hairy if for example we want to make another move transaction, or we want to call another contract method that might depend on position.

## Use Tevm as an optimistic client

We can create a second client using Tevm that can act as our optimistic client.

```typescript
// ...same imports as before
import { createTevmTransport } from 'tevm'

// ...same client code as before

const optimisticClient = createClient({
  chain: redstone,
  transport: createTevmTransport({
    fork: {
      // we are telling Tevm
      transport: client
    }
  })
}).extend(walletActions).extend(publicActions)

const optimisticMovePlayer = (direction: string) => {
  // Optimistically execute and send tx in parallel
  optimisticClient.tevmContract({
    from: account.address,
    address: GameContract.address,
    abi: GameContract.abi,
    functionName: 'movePlayer',
    args: [direction],
  }).then(result => {
    const newPosition = await optimisticClient.readContract({
      // blockTag 'pending' will take into account pending tx
      blockTag: 'pending',
      address: GameContract.address,
      abi: GameContract.abi,
      functionName: 'getPlayerPosition',
      args: [],
    })
    renderNewPosition(newPosition)
  })

  // Perform the actual transaction
  const hash = await client.writeContract({
    address: GameContract.address,
    abi: GameContract.abi,
    functionName: 'movePlayer',
    args: [direction],
  })

  await client.waitForReceipt({hash})

  // update optimistic state after tx is included in cannonical chain
  await optimisticClient.getTxPool().then(txPool => txPool.removeByHash(hash))
}
```

:::warning [Not production code]
For simplicity of the demonstration we do not handle errors in the above code. We highly recomend using an abstraction like tansatck query, zustand, effect.ts or any other option to help manage the async state here.
