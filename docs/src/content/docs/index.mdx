## Features

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Tevm memory devnet" icon="pencil">
		Execute JavaScript directly in your TypeScript code without the need for an external RPC. [EVM execution and forking](/learn/clients) akin to [anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/anvil)
	</Card>
	<Card title="Familiar api" icon="open-book">
		Tevm is built on top of the Viem api and plugs right into your existing Viem/Wagmi applications. Adapters exist for Ethers.js as well.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Solidity scripting" icon="add-document">
		A powerful [solidity scripting](/learn/scripting) support akin to [foundry scripts](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/solidity-scripting). Powerful use cases like writing a server/indexer in solidity.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Solidity imports" icon="setting">
		[Importing solidity files](/learn/solidity-imports) directly into TypeScript. No need to set up complicated build pipelines. Just import the contract from your repo or node_modules. Support for generating from a live deployment coming soon.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Runs in all environments" icon="open-book">
		Tevm runs in the browser, node.js, and bun. Everything you could only previously do in other languages or on the server is now possible everywhere JavaScript runs.
	</Card>
