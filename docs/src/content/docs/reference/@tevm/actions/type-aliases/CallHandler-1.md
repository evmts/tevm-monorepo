or undeployed scripts

const res = tevm.call({
to: '0x123...',
data: '0x123...',
from: '0x123...',
gas: 1000000,
gasPrice: 1n,
skipBalance: true,
}
```

## Parameters

â€¢ **action**: [`CallParams`](/reference/tevm/actions/type-aliases/callparams-1/)

## Returns

`Promise`\<[`CallResult`](/reference/tevm/actions/type-aliases/callresult-1/)\>
