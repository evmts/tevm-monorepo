> **ContractJsonRpcProcedure**: [`CallJsonRpcRequest`](/reference/tevm/procedures-types/type-aliases/calljsonrpcrequest/)

Since ContractJsonRpcProcedure is a quality of life wrapper around CallJsonRpcProcedure
 We choose to overload the type instead of creating a new one. Tevm contract handlers encode their
 contract call as a normal call request over JSON-rpc
