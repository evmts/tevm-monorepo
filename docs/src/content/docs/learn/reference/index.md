## Overview

Tevm reference docs are autogenerated from their TypeScript types and jsdoc annotations. This guide organizes the generated docs contextually.

Most of tevm is available in a barrel package `tevm`.

The tevm api is vast because all internal packages are made publically available. For most users they will be best off sticking to the [getting-started](../../getting-started/getting-started/) and `guides` which go over the main top-level apis.

## Runtime packages

### Memory client and actions apis packages

The following packages are used to build `MemoryClient`:

- [@tevm/actions](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/actions) Implements the [tevm ActionsApi](https://tevm.sh/reference/tevm/decorators/type-aliases/tevmactionsapi/) along with actions for handling ethereum JSON-RPC requests.
- [@tevm/node](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/node) The base client extended by memory-client and used to implement `@tevm/actions`. It is currently built on top of the [ethereumjs api](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo)
- [@tevm/contract](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/contract) Implements the `Contract` and `Scripts`. These are used at runtime and also generated by the buildtime tevm compiler.

### Ethereum EVM packages

The following packages are used to implement node and are the lowest level packages implementing the Tevm VM.
They all are modified from ethereumjs either as custom implementations implementing the same interface or extending it's functionality.

Note: many of these packages hold a [MLP-2.0](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mozilla-public-license-2-0-mpl-2) license because they are adapted from ethereumjs rather than an MIT license.0

- [@tevm/block](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/block) A simple package representing ethereum blocks. It is used by the `@tevm/blockchain` package

- [@tevm/common](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/common) This package holds common blockchain information such as gas fee information by network
- [@tevm/evm](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/evm) Contains the EVM to execute bytecode. It lightly wraps the ethereumjs evm with custom tevm types/functionality

- [@tevm/trie](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/trie) Simply reexports `@ethereumjs/trie`.
- [@tevm/tx](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/tx) A custom implementation of the `@ethereumjs/tx` package that notably has a new tx type called `ImpersonatedTx` for unsigned tx that are meant to impersonate signed ones in the EVM.
- [@tevm/txpool](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/txpool) A mempool implementation that holds the state of transactions that have not yet bein included in `@tevm/blockchain`

### Tevm extensions

The following packages extend tevm functionality for compatability with other popular libraries and technologies.

- [@tevm/ethers](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/extensions/ethers) Contains an ethers provider similar to `MemoryClient` as well as typesafe ethers contracts
- [@tevm/viem](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/extensions/viem) Contains useful utils for extending viem with tevm functionality.

## Buildtime packages

### Util packages

The following package isn't specific to the bundler per-say but still used by the bundler.

- [@tevm/effect](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/effect) The tevm compiler uses [effect.ts](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect) under the hood and this package has common code for using it. In future versions the runtime might be migrated to Effect as well.

### Base bundler implementation

The tevm bundler is built agnostic of any specific bundler and then reused to implement specific bundlers with a single implementation. The following packages make it up

- [@tevm/base-bundler](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/bundler-packages/base-bundler) is the main package implementing the tevm bundler. It generates typescript and javascript files when given a path to a solidity file.
- [@tevm/compiler](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/bundler-packages/compiler) The internal package that compiles solidity to it's abi and bytecode artifacts as well as generating an AST
- [@tevm/config](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/bundler-packages/config) The internal package in charge of reading and validating a `tevm.config.json` file
- [@tevm/resolutions](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/bundler-packages/resolutions) The internal package in charge of resolving solidity import graphs. It handles things like remappings, loading solidity from node_modules, and creating the overall build graph.
- [@tevm/runtime](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/bundler-packages/runtime) The internal package in charge of turning solidity artifacts into Typescript/JavaScript runtime code
- [@tevm/solc](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/bundler-packages/solc) A simple typesafe wrapper around [solc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html) used by `@tevm/compiler` to compile solidity contracts.

### Specific bundler implementations

The following bundlers use `@tevm/base-bundler` to implement support for specific bundlers

### LSP

In addition to implementing `bundlers` the `@tevm/base-bundler` is also used to implement the tevm Typescript LSP plugins and wrappers to allow typescript to infer types from solidity.

- [@tevm/ts-plugin](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/lsp/ts-plugin) The current implementation of the TypeScript lsp as a ts plugin
- [@tevm/lsp](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/lsp/lsp) The next generation version of the lsp built with [volar](https://volarjs.dev/). This version of the LSP will unblock future improvements, stabilize the LSP, simplify the internal code, and allow for easy debugging.
- [@tevm/vscode](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/lsp/vscode) A vscode plugin for tevm built on top of `@tevm/lsp` volar package
