## Overview

Tevm reference docs are autogenerated from their TypeScript types and jsdoc annotations. This guide organizes the generated docs contextually.

All runtime packages are available both as standalone packages (`@tevm/actions`) or conveniently in a `barrel` package. `tevm`.
All buildtime packages like the typescript or webpack plugin are similarly available both as a standalone `@tevm/ts-plugin` and in a `barrel` package `@tevm/bundler`

## TevmClient api

All clients share the `TevmClient` api which is how you interact with the EVM. The following reference docs contain it's api.

- [@tevm/client-types](/reference/tevm/client-types/api/) - Contains the [TevmClient](/reference/tevm/client-types/type-aliases/tevmclient) all `Clients` share. This is usually the best place to start.
- [@tevm/actions-types](/reference/tevm/actions-types/api/) - Contains the [actions api](/learn/actions) definitions
- [@tevm/procedures-types](/reference/tevm/procedures-types/api/) - Contains the [JSON-RPC](/learn/json-rpc/) definitions

## Clients

In addition to the `TevmClient` api above documentation about specific clients exists in following packages:A

- [@tevm/memory-client](/reference/tevm/memory-client/api/) - The main in memory EVM client
- [@tevm/http-client](/reference/tevm/http-client/api/) - A client that executes via a remote MemoryClient over (http)[#Server]

There are also extension clients for [viem](https://viem.sh) and [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)

- [@tevm/viem](/reference/tevm/viem/api/)
- [@tevm/ethers](/reference/tevm/ethers/api/)

## Contracts

A common way of using `contract action` with tevm is Tevm [`Contracts` and `Scripts`](/learn/contracts/). They are defined in the `@tevm/contracts` package

- [@tevm/contract](/reference/tevm/contract/api/)

## Scripting

Package for creating [precompiles for scripting](../scripting/) enables JavaScript precompiles to be added to the VM.

- [@tevm/precompiles](/reference/tevm/precompiles/api)

## Server

- [@tevm/server](/reference/tevm/server/api/) - Contains utilities to run Tevm as an JSON-RPC http server in Node, Bun, express, and Next.js.

## Implementation

The following internal packages contain the majority of the implementation code. All the packages above so far are sufficient for exploring the api. But if you want to dive deeper into implementation source code the following packages can be useful.

- [@tevm/actions](/reference/tevm/actions/api/) - Contains decorators that decorate [ethereumjs](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) with the Tevm api.
- [@tevm/procedures](/reference/tevm/procedures/api/) - Contains decorators that decorate [ethereumjs](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo) with the Tevm JSON-rpc api.

## @tevm/bundler

To configure your bundler setup navigate to your bundler's plugins docs [`@tevm/*-plugin`](/reference/tevm/vite-plugin/api)

- [@tevm/bun-plugin](/reference/tevm/bun-plugin/api/)
- [@tevm/esbuild-plugin](/reference/tevm/esbuild-plugin/api/)
- [@tevm/rollup-plugin](/reference/tevm/rollup-plugin/api/)
- [@tevm/rspack-plugin](/reference/tevm/rspack-plugin/api/)
- [@tevm/vite-plugin](/reference/tevm/vite-plugin/api/)
- [@tevm/webpack-plugin](/reference/tevm/webpack-plugin/api/)

There is also config documentation below but you are most likely only interested in the [CompilerConfig](/reference/tevm/config/types/type-aliases/compilerconfig) docs.

- [@tevm/config](/reference/tevm/config/api/)

Bundlers bundle solidity via turning their imports into `Contract` and `Script` instances. We already listed this package but for convenience it is below:

- [@tevm/contract](/reference/tevm/contract/api/)

## Internal packages

There are more internal packages that aren't listed in this documentation but still have documentation on github in their `docs` folder.

Runtime packages

- [@tevm/effect](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/effect) - Contains [effect](https://www.effect.website/) related utilities
- [@tevm/state](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/state) - Contains the custom EVM state implementation for tevm. 
- [@tevm/revm](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/experimental/revm) - Contains an experimental wasm build of revm. Future versions of Tevm may replace some components with revm.
- [@tevm/schemas](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/experimental/schemas) - Contains experimental `effect schemas` for ethereum types.
- [@tevm/viem-effect](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/experimental/viem-effect) - Contains an experimental package that strongly types viem errors using [effect](https://www.effect.website/)

Buildtime packages

- [@tevm/base-bundler](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/bundler/base-bundler) - Contains the Javascript bundler implementation used internally by all other bundlers
- [@tevm/compiler](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/bundler/compiler) - Contains the Tevm solidity compiler implementation
- [@tevm/solc](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/bundler/solc) - Contains a thin wrapper around [`solc`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html) that adds typescript types.
- [@tevm/ts-plugin](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/lsp/ts-plugin) - Contains the implementation of of typescript language service plugin. This enables your editor to understand solidity imports.
- [@tevm/lsp](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/lsp/lsp) - Contains an experimental rewrite of the LSP using `volar`. This will upgrade the LSP features and give Tevm `Svelte` and `Vue` support once ready.
- [@tevm/experimental-solc](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/experimental/solc) - Contains experimental package that fetches solc at runtime via an ESM import
