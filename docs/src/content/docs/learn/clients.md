## Tevm Clients

The interface to Tevm api is called [TevmClient](../../reference/@tevm/client-types/type-aliases/TevmClient.md). This api provides a uniform API for interacting with Tevm whether interacting with a [MemoryClient](./memory-client.md) directly or remotely interacting via an [HttpCLient](../../reference/@tevm/http-client/type-aliases/HttpClient.md). Tevm clients share the same [actions](./actions.md) based interface along with a [`request`](../reference/@tevm/memory-client/type-aliases/MemoryClient.md#request) method for handling JSON-RPC requests.

The following clients are available

- [MemoryClient](./memory-client.md) - An in memory instance of the EVM that can run in Node.js, bun or the browser
- [HttpClient](./http-client.md) - A client that talks to a remote `MemoryClient` running in an [http server](../reference/@tevm/server/API.md) 
- [Viem extensions](../reference/@tevm/viem/API.md) - Provides a viem based client instance and some experimental optimistic updating apis.
- ðŸš§ Under construction [Ethers extensions](../reference/@tevm/ethers/API.md) - An ethers based memory client and http client
- ðŸš§ Under construction `WebsocketClient` - A web socket based TevmClient similar to the `HttpClient`

## Actions

The main interface for interacting with any Tevm client is it's `actions api`. See [actions api](./actions.md) guide or the [TevmClient reference](../reference/@tevm/client-types/type-aliases/TevmClient.md) for more information.

## Procedures

Tevm also has an `client.request` method for doing JSON procedure calls.  For `MemoryClient` this procedure call happens in memory and for `HttpClient` this procedure call is resolved remotely using JSON-RPC (JSON remote procedure call). For more information see the [JSON-RPC](./json-rpc.md) docs and the [`client.request`](../reference/@tevm/procedures-types/type-aliases/TevmJsonRpcRequestHandler.md) generated reference docs.
