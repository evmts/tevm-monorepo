# @tevm/receipt-manager

The `@tevm/receipt-manager` package provides a robust transaction receipt management system for the Tevm blockchain. It handles the storage, retrieval, and management of transaction receipts, logs, and related data.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @tevm/receipt-manager
```

## Overview

The receipt manager package is responsible for:
- Managing transaction receipts and their storage
- Handling transaction logs and bloom filters
- Supporting different receipt types (Pre-Byzantium, Post-Byzantium, EIP4844)
- Providing efficient receipt lookup and retrieval

## Core Components

### ReceiptsManager

The main class that handles receipt management operations.

```typescript
import { ReceiptsManager } from '@tevm/receipt-manager'

const receiptsManager = new ReceiptsManager(mapDb, chain)
```

#### Key Methods

- `saveReceipts(block, receipts)`: Saves receipts to the database
- `getReceipts(blockHash)`: Retrieves receipts for a given block hash
- `getReceiptByTxHash(txHash)`: Gets a receipt by transaction hash
- `getLogs(from, to, addresses?, topics?)`: Returns logs based on filter criteria
- `deleteReceipts(block)`: Removes receipts for a given block

### Receipt Types

The package supports multiple receipt types to accommodate different Ethereum protocol versions:

#### BaseTxReceipt
```typescript
interface BaseTxReceipt {
  cumulativeBlockGasUsed: bigint
  bitvector: Uint8Array
  logs: Log[]
}
```

#### PreByzantiumTxReceipt
```typescript
interface PreByzantiumTxReceipt extends BaseTxReceipt {
  stateRoot: Uint8Array
}
```

#### PostByzantiumTxReceipt
```typescript
interface PostByzantiumTxReceipt extends BaseTxReceipt {
  status: 0 | 1
}
```

#### EIP4844BlobTxReceipt
```typescript
interface EIP4844BlobTxReceipt extends PostByzantiumTxReceipt {
  blobGasUsed: bigint
  blobGasPrice: bigint
}
```

## Database Management

### MapDb

The package includes a MapDb implementation for storing receipt data:

```typescript
import { createMapDb } from '@tevm/receipt-manager'

const mapDb = createMapDb({
  cache: new Map()
})
```

### Configuration Options

```typescript
interface MetaDBManagerOptions {
  cache: Map<`0x${string}`, Uint8Array>
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Saving and Retrieving Receipts

```typescript
// Save receipts
await receiptsManager.saveReceipts(block, receipts)

// Retrieve receipts by block hash
const receipts = await receiptsManager.getReceipts(blockHash)

// Get receipt by transaction hash
const receipt = await receiptsManager.getReceiptByTxHash(txHash)
```

### Working with Logs

```typescript
// Query logs with filters
const logs = await receiptsManager.getLogs(
  fromBlock,
  toBlock,
  addresses,
  topics
)
```

## Constants and Limits

The ReceiptsManager includes several important limits:

```typescript
GET_LOGS_LIMIT = 10000 // Maximum number of logs to return
GET_LOGS_LIMIT_MEGABYTES = 150 // Size limit for getLogs response
GET_LOGS_BLOCK_RANGE_LIMIT = 2500 // Block range limit for getLogs
```

## Error Handling

The package includes proper error handling for common scenarios:

```typescript
try {
  const receipt = await receiptsManager.getReceiptByTxHash(txHash)
  if (!receipt) {
    // Handle missing receipt
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Handle errors
}
```

## Types

The package exports several important types:

```typescript
type TxReceipt = PreByzantiumTxReceipt | PostByzantiumTxReceipt | EIP4844BlobTxReceipt
type TxReceiptWithType = PreByzantiumTxReceiptWithType | PostByzantiumTxReceiptWithType
type DbType = "Receipts" | "TxHash" | "SkeletonBlock" | "SkeletonBlockHashToNumber" |
  "SkeletonStatus" | "SkeletonUnfinalizedBlockByHash" | "Preimage"
```
