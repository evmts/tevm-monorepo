## Docs

- [Getting Started](/getting-started): Welcome to [Tevm Node](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo)! This guide will help you navigate our documentation and get started with running [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) in JavaScript.
- [Custom Precompiles](/advanced/custom-precompiles): [Tevm Node](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo) allows you to extend the [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) with custom [precompiled contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/precompiles/) written in JavaScript. These precompiles can provide native functionality at specific addresses, similar to [Ethereum's built-in precompiles](https://www.evm.codes/precompiled).
- [Performance & Profiler](/advanced/performance-profiler): Tevm Node includes a built-in performance profiler that helps you analyze EVM execution, identify bottlenecks, and optimize your smart contracts.
- [Receipts & Logs](/advanced/receipts-and-logs): Tevm Node provides robust support for managing transaction receipts and event logs through the ReceiptsManager module and filter system.
- [Transaction Pool](/advanced/txpool): The Transaction Pool (TxPool) is a crucial component that manages pending transactions before they're included in blocks. It handles transaction ordering, replacement, validation, and lifecycle management.
- [Building a Debugger UI](/examples/debugger-ui): This example demonstrates how to create a minimal EVM debugger interface using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and Tevm Node. The debugger will show:
- [Using with Ethers.js](/examples/ethers): This guide demonstrates how to use Tevm Node with Ethers.js, enabling seamless integration with the popular Ethereum development library.

- [Local Testing](/examples/local-testing): This guide demonstrates how to use Tevm Node for local testing of [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) and [transactions](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/). For more background on testing Ethereum applications, see the [Smart Contract Testing Guide](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/testing/).
- [Using with Viem](/examples/viem): This guide demonstrates how to use Tevm Node with Viem, enabling seamless integration with Viem's powerful Ethereum development tools.
- [Creating a Tevm Node](/core/create-tevm-node): `createTevmNode` is the main entry point for spinning up a local Tevm Node instance. It provides a flexible configuration API to customize your node's behavior for different use cases.
- [Forking Networks](/core/forking): Tevm's forking capability allows you to create a local instance that mirrors the state of any live Ethereum network or another Tevm instance. This is incredibly useful for:
- [Managing State](/core/managing-state): Tevm Node provides powerful state management capabilities through its `stateManager` interface. This allows you to interact with and modify Ethereum state, including accounts, contract code, and storage.
- [TevmNode Interface](/core/tevm-node-interface): The `TevmNode` interface is the core API surface of Tevm. It provides access to all the fundamental Ethereum node capabilities, from transaction processing to state management.
- [Architecture Overview](/introduction/architecture-overview): [Tevm Node](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo) is a JavaScript implementation of an Ethereum node that can run in any JavaScript environment - browsers, Node.js, or other runtimes. It provides a complete [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) with state management, transaction processing, and JSON-RPC support.
- [Installation & Quickstart](/introduction/installation): Explore the [Core Concepts](../core/create-tevm-node)
- [What is Tevm Node?](/introduction/what-is-tevm-node): Tevm Node is an in-browser & Node.js-compatible Ethereum Node. It provides a complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution environment, powered by JavaScript, that you can run:
- [Why run Ethereum in JavaScript?](/introduction/why-run-ethereum-in-js): Running the EVM locally removes round-trip latency to a remote node. You can do:
- [Account Management](/api/account-management): Tevm provides two key actions for managing account state: `getAccountHandler` and `setAccountHandler`.
- [@tevm/actions](/api/actions): **Generated API Documentation**: View the full API documentation in the [evmts/tevm-monorepo/packages/actions/docs](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/actions/docs) folder.
- [Block](/api/block): The `@tevm/block` package provides functionality for working with Ethereum blocks. It includes classes and utilities for handling block headers, block data, and block-related operations.
- [Blockchain Package](/api/blockchain): The `@tevm/blockchain` package provides a custom implementation of the Ethereum blockchain, offering functionality for managing blocks, handling chain state, and interacting with the blockchain.
- [Common Package](/api/common): The `@tevm/common` package provides chain-specific configuration and utilities for Tevm clients. It wraps both Viem chain configurations and EthereumJS Common functionality to provide a unified interface for chain parameters, hardforks, and EIPs.
- [Contract Utilities](/api/contracts): The [`tevm/contract`](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/contract) package provides powerful utilities for working with [Ethereum smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/), offering type-safe contract interactions and simplified deployment workflows.
- [@tevm/decorators](/api/decorators): The `@tevm/decorators` package provides a set of decorators and APIs for extending Tevm clients with additional functionality. It includes implementations for both standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods and Tevm-specific actions.
- [EVM Events](/api/evm-events): Tevm Node provides access to low-level EVM events through the VM's event emitter. This allows you to monitor and debug contract execution at a granular level.
- [@tevm/evm](/api/evm): The `@tevm/evm` package provides a custom implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), extending the functionality of `ethereumjs/evm`. It's responsible for executing Ethereum bytecode and managing the execution environment.
- [JSON-RPC Support](/api/json-rpc): Tevm Node provides comprehensive [JSON-RPC](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) support through an [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compatible interface. This allows seamless integration with popular Ethereum libraries and tools.
