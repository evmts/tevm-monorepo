# Why run Ethereum in JavaScript?

## 1. Advanced Gas Estimation & Local Execution

Running the EVM locally removes round-trip latency to a remote node. You can do:

- Bulk simulation or multi-tx simulation
- Real-time "dry run" of transactions
- Faster dev/test cycles

## 2. User Experience Enhancements

- **Offline** or *local-first* capabilities
- **Optimistic UI** updates with local simulation
- No reliance on ephemeral test networks

## 3. Testing & Debugging

- Fine-grained EVM introspection
- Deterministic environment
- Light footprint â€“ no external server needed

## 4. Ecosystem & Portability

- Portable across Node.js, browsers, and serverless
- Works with standard EVM interfaces
- Integrates well with modern JS/TS tooling
