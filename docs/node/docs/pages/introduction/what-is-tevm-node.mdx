# What is Tevm Node?

Tevm Node is an in-browser & Node.js-compatible Ethereum Node. It provides a complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution environment, powered by JavaScript, that you can run:

- **In Node.js** for local or CI testing.
- **In the Browser** for advanced user experiences (offline, real-time simulation, etc.).
- **In Deno, Bun**, or any modern JS environment.

## Key Features

- **Forking:** Simulate mainnet or testnet state from a live RPC, similar to Hardhat or Anvil.
- **TxPool (Mempool):** Keep track of unmined transactions locally.
- **Mining Config:** Choose between auto mining, interval-based mining, manual, or gas-limit-based mining.
- **Zero dependencies on native modules** â€“ works seamlessly in the browser.
- **Extendable:** Hook into the VM, custom precompiles, receipts, and more.

## Motivations / Why Tevm Node

- **Browser/Local Execution** for improved latency & advanced debugging.
- **Optimistic updates**: Inspect tx side effects before on-chain mining.
- **Lightweight**: Slashes overhead vs. running a full geth or anvil node.
- **Network independence**: Freed from real chain constraints in your applications.
