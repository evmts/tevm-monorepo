# What is Tevm Node?

Tevm Node is an in-browser & Node.js-compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment. It provides a complete Ethereum execution environment, powered by JavaScript, that you can run:

- **In Node.js** for local development and testing
- **In the Browser** for advanced user experiences (offline simulation, real-time testing)
- **In Deno, Bun**, or any modern JavaScript runtime

## Key Features

- **Forking:** Fork from any EVM-compatible network (mainnet, testnet) with efficient caching
- **Transaction Pool:** Track and manage pending transactions locally
- **Flexible Mining:** Choose between automatic, interval-based, manual, or gas-limit-based mining
- **Zero Native Dependencies:** Works seamlessly in browsers and JavaScript runtimes
- **Highly Extensible:** Customize the VM, add precompiles, handle receipts, and more

## Quick Example

```ts
import { createTevmNode, http } from 'tevm'

// Create a node that forks from Optimism
const node = createTevmNode({
  fork: {
    transport: http('https://mainnet.optimism.io')
  }
})

const vm = await node.getVm()
console.log(await vm.blockchain.getBlockByTag('latest'))
```

## Why Tevm Node?

- **Browser & Local Execution:** Improved latency and advanced debugging capabilities
- **Optimistic Updates:** Preview transaction effects before on-chain confirmation
- **Lightweight:** Minimal overhead compared to full Ethereum nodes
- **Network Independent:** Test and develop without real network constraints

## Important Note

Tevm Node is designed primarily for development, testing, and simulation. While it implements the full EVM specification, it is not recommended for production mainnet validation or as a replacement for full consensus nodes.
