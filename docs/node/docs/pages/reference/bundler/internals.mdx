# Bundler Internals

This page explains the internal workings of the Tevm bundler to help you understand how it transforms Solidity contracts into TypeScript modules.

## Architecture Overview

All Tevm bundler plugins share a unified core (`@tevm/base-bundler`). This architecture ensures consistent behavior across different build tools while allowing each plugin to adapt to its specific environment.

The bundler pipeline consists of several key stages:

## 1. Import Detection & Resolution

When the bundler encounters a `.sol` import, it:

- Parses the import statement using regex to extract the import path
- Converts relative paths to absolute paths
- Applies custom remappings from various sources (tsconfig.json paths, foundry remappings, tevm.config.json)
- Handles node_modules resolution for npm packages
- Supports special import formats like `.s.sol` for bytecode inclusion

The import resolution mechanism merges multiple sources of configuration:

```
User Import → Node.js Resolution + Foundry Remappings → Absolute File Path
```

This allows the bundler to support both traditional JavaScript module resolution and Solidity/Foundry-style import resolution simultaneously.

## 2. Compilation

Once all imports are resolved, the bundler:

- Creates a dependency graph of all imported Solidity files
- Passes the full source code and import structure to solc (the Solidity compiler)
- If the file ends in `.s.sol`, both ABI and bytecode are generated; otherwise only ABI is produced
- Extracts metadata, NatSpec documentation, and optionally the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

The compilation step handles error reporting and version management for the Solidity compiler.

## 3. Code Generation

After compilation, the bundler:

- Generates a TypeScript (or JavaScript) module that exports a Tevm Contract instance
- Creates type definitions for all contract methods, events, and errors
- Maps Solidity types to TypeScript types (uint256 → bigint, address → string, etc.)
- Adds metadata, ABI, and optionally bytecode as properties of the exported contract
- Generates `.read` and `.write` method interfaces for type-safe contract interaction

The code generation step preserves NatSpec documentation as JSDoc comments, allowing editors to display contract documentation on hover.

## 4. Caching

To improve build performance, the bundler:

- Stores compiled artifacts in a `.tevm` directory
- Caches based on file content hashes, not just timestamps
- Avoids unnecessary recompilation when source files haven't changed
- Stores intermediate artifacts (ABI, bytecode) separately from generated code
- Handles cache invalidation when dependencies or compiler settings change

The caching system balances build speed with correctness by selectively invalidating only affected parts of the cache.

## 5. LSP & TS Plugin Integration

The final piece of the bundler architecture is the TypeScript Language Service Plugin:

- The `@tevm/ts-plugin` hooks into the TypeScript compiler
- References bundler outputs to provide type information for `.sol` imports
- Enables advanced IDE features:
  - Contract-level auto-completion
  - Go-to-definition for contract methods
  - Hover documentation showing NatSpec comments
  - Type checking for contract method arguments and return values

The plugin bridges the gap between the build-time bundler process and the development-time editor experience.

## Internal Implementation Details

### Module Factory

The bundler uses a module factory pattern to create a dependency graph of all Solidity files:

```ts
// Internal implementation (simplified)
function moduleFactory(entry, source, remappings, libs) {
  const modules = new Map()
  const queue = [{ path: entry, source }]
  
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const { path, source } = queue.shift()
    if (modules.has(path)) continue
    
    // Find all imports in the source
    const imports = resolveImports(path, source, remappings, libs)
    
    // Add to module map
    modules.set(path, {
      id: path,
      source,
      imports: imports.map(i => i.path)
    })
    
    // Queue imports for processing
    for (const imp of imports) {
      if (!modules.has(imp.path)) {
        queue.push({ path: imp.path, source: readFile(imp.path) })
      }
    }
  }
  
  return modules
}
```

### Solidity Compiler Integration

The bundler interfaces with the Solidity compiler through a standardized API:

```ts
// Internal implementation (simplified)
function compile(sources, settings) {
  const input = {
    language: 'Solidity',
    sources: Object.fromEntries(
      Array.from(sources.entries()).map(
        ([path, { content }]) => [path, { content }]
      )
    ),
    settings: {
      outputSelection: {
        '*': {
          '*': ['abi', 'evm.bytecode', 'evm.deployedBytecode', 'metadata', 'userdoc', 'devdoc']
        }
      },
      ...settings
    }
  }
  
  return solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input), { import: resolveImport })
}
```

### Contract Instance Generation

The bundler generates a TypeScript module that exports a Tevm Contract instance:

```ts
// Generated code (simplified)
import { createContract } from 'tevm/contract'

export const MyContract = createContract({
  abi: [...], // ABI from compiler
  bytecode: '0x...', // Optional, only for .s.sol files
  deployedBytecode: '0x...', // Optional, only for .s.sol files
})

// Strongly typed methods available via:
// MyContract.read.methodName
// MyContract.write.methodName
```
