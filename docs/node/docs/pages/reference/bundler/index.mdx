# Tevm Contract Bundler

The Tevm Contract Bundler allows you to import Solidity files directly into your TypeScript code, enabling a seamless development experience with type safety and IDE integration.

:::note
Tevm Node is the primary product. Using the bundler is optional. You can also generate contract types with `npx tevm gen` (see [Codegen Approach](/reference/bundler/troubleshooting#codegen-approach)).

## Quick Navigation

The bundler documentation is split into several sections for better organization:

- **[Overview](/reference/bundler/overview)** - Introduction, key benefits, available plugins
- **[Internals](/reference/bundler/internals)** - How the bundler works under the hood
- **[Methods & Exports](/reference/bundler/methods)** - Key APIs for advanced usage
- **[Troubleshooting](/reference/bundler/troubleshooting)** - Common issues and solutions

## What is the Tevm Bundler?

The Tevm bundler transforms Solidity `.sol` files into TypeScript modules at build time. When you import a contract, the bundler:

1. Reads and compiles the Solidity source code
2. Extracts the ABI, bytecode, and other contract information
3. Generates a TypeScript module with a [Tevm Contract](/reference/contract) instance

This means you can interact with your contracts in a fully type-safe way, with editor features like auto-completion, go-to-definition, and inline documentation.

## Getting Started

For a quick introduction to using the bundler, see the [Bundler Quickstart](/getting-started/bundler) guide.

If you're looking for detailed reference information, explore the sections above.

## Coming Soon Features

Tevm is actively developing new bundler features:

- **Inline Solidity with `sol` Tag** - Define contracts directly in your JS/TS using template literals
- **CAIP-10 Contract Imports** - Import contracts from any chain using standardized identifiers

Learn more about these upcoming features in the [Upcoming Features](/reference/bundler/overview#coming-soon-features) section.
