# Bundler Troubleshooting

This guide addresses common issues that may arise when using the Tevm bundler.

## Common Issues

### 1. Missing or Red Underlines in Editor

**Symptoms**: Your editor shows red underlines for Solidity imports, or auto-completion doesn't work.

**Solution**:
- Confirm you have `"plugins": [{ "name": "@tevm/ts-plugin" }]` in tsconfig.json
- In VS Code or Cursor, switch to the "workspace version" of TypeScript:
  1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
  2. Type "TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version"
  3. Select "Use Workspace Version"
- For Vim, Neovim, and other editors, ensure they're using the workspace TypeScript version

### 2. Type-check Errors with Next.js

**Symptoms**: Your build works, but Next.js type-checking fails with errors about `.sol` imports.

**Solution**:
- Next's built-in type checker might not handle dynamic `.sol` imports well
- Option 1: Disable type-checking in next.config.mjs:
  ```js
  // next.config.mjs
  export default {
    typescript: {
      // Typechecking will only be available after the LSP is migrated to volar
      // Until then typechecking will work in editor but not during a next.js build 
      ignoreBuildErrors: true,
    }
  }
  ```
- Option 2: Use the [Codegen Approach](#codegen-approach) (recommended for Next.js)

### 3. "File Not Found" Errors

**Symptoms**: Bundler can't find imported Solidity files, especially with custom paths.

**Solution**:
- Check that your libraries or local imports are accounted for in libs or remappings
- If you're using Foundry, ensure `foundryProject: true` is set in tevm.config.json
- For npm packages, verify they're installed and the import path is correct
- For complex import structures, add explicit remappings:
  ```json
  // tevm.config.json
  {
    "remappings": {
      "@customlib/": "node_modules/@customlib/",
      "local/": "./contracts/"
    }
  }
  ```

### 4. Cache Stale Issues

**Symptoms**: Changes to Solidity files don't appear to take effect.

**Solution**:
- If a contract's changes don't appear to be recognized, remove the `.tevm` folder and rebuild
- The `.tevm` directory is ephemeral - you can safely delete it at any time
- Add `.tevm` to your `.gitignore` to prevent caching issues in version control

### 5. No Bytecode Available

**Symptoms**: Contract deployment fails with errors about missing bytecode.

**Solution**:
- Check that you're using the `.s.sol` extension for contracts you want to deploy
- Regular `.sol` files only generate ABIs, not deployable bytecode
- Rename your file from `Contract.sol` to `Contract.s.sol` if you need bytecode

### 6. Deployment Errors

**Symptoms**: Contract deployment fails even with bytecode available.

**Solution**:
- Make sure you're calling `.deploy()` with any required constructor arguments:
  ```ts
  // Incorrect (when contract has constructor args)
  const deployed = await client.deployContract(MyToken)
  
  // Correct
  const deployed = await client.deployContract(
    MyToken.deploy("TokenName", "TKN", 18)
  )
  ```

### 7. Test Runner Issues

**Symptoms**: Tests using `.sol` imports fail in Jest or other test runners.

**Solution**:
- Most test runners (Vitest) work out-of-the-box once the bundler plugin is configured
- For Jest, you might need extra configuration or use the codegen approach
- Consider using the bundler that matches your test environment (esbuild for Vitest, etc.)

## Codegen Approach

If you're encountering persistent bundler-related issues, particularly with frameworks like Next.js, or if you prefer to have explicit TypeScript files for your contracts, the codegen approach may be better suited for your needs.

### What is Codegen?

The codegen approach generates `.ts` files from your `.sol` files ahead of time, rather than during the build process. This results in regular TypeScript files that can be imported normally.

### Using Codegen

To generate TypeScript files for your Solidity contracts:

```bash
npx tevm gen
```

This will:
- Generate `.ts` files next to each `.sol` file (or wherever configured)
- Create TypeScript files that you can commit to source control
- Produce the same output as the bundler, but in a pre-build step

These generated `.ts` files can be imported directly in your code:

```ts
// Import the generated TypeScript file
import { MyContract } from './contracts/MyContract.js'
```

### When to Use Codegen

Codegen is especially helpful when:

- You have a framework that tightly controls its build pipeline (e.g., Next.js with enforced type-checking)
- You prefer explicit, committed TypeScript artifacts for contracts
- You want a stable CI pipeline or want to avoid runtime resolution
- You're using Jest or another test runner that has difficulty with dynamic imports

### Codegen Configuration

You can configure the codegen tool by adding options to your `tevm.config.json`:

```json
{
  "gen": {
    "outDir": "./generated",  // Where to generate files
    "patterns": ["contracts/**/*.sol"],  // Which files to process
    "exclude": ["**/node_modules/**"]    // Which files to ignore
  }
}
```
