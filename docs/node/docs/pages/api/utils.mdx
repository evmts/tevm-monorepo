# Utilities & Addresses

Tevm exports a set of lightweight utility functions and classes. Many of these build upon lower-level packages like [`@tevm/utils`](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/utils) and [`viem`](https://viem.sh) while standardizing usage for Tevm Node. Below are the most commonly used.

## createAddress

Creates an [Ethereum address](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#account-creation) from various input formats:

```ts
import { createAddress } from '@tevm/address'

// Creates a TEVM-style Address object from various input forms
let addr = createAddress(`0x${"00".repeat(20)}`)
// from a hex string
addr = createAddress(420n)
// from a bigint
addr = createAddress(new Uint8Array(20))
// from a 20-byte array
```

### Signature

```ts
declare function createAddress(
  address: number | bigint | string | Uint8Array | EthjsAddress
): Address
```

### Behavior & Notes

- Accepts various input types: [`0x`-prefixed hex strings](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/hex/), unprefixed hex, numbers, bigints, `Uint8Array`s, or `EthjsAddress`.
- Throws `InvalidAddressError` if it can't parse a valid 20-byte address from the input.

## Address Class

A thin wrapper around [`EthjsAddress`](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/util) offering a simple, consistent shape for Tevm Node. Created by `createAddress` or by forging your own:

```ts
import { Address } from '@tevm/address'

const a = new Address(Uint8Array.from([ /* 20 bytes */ ]))
console.log(a.bytes)  // a raw 20-byte address
console.log(a.toString()) // 0x....
```

## createContractAddress

Creates a contract address following [EIP-1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014):

```ts
import { createContractAddress } from '@tevm/address'

// from an existing address + nonce, produce the CREATE address
const from = createAddress("0x1111...1111")
const nonce = 1n
const contractAddr = createContractAddress(from, nonce)
```

### Usage
1. Follows standard Ethereum's [`keccak256(rlp([senderAddress, nonce]))[-20..]`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/deploying/#how-to-deploy-a-smart-contract).
2. Ideal for simulating `CREATE` addresses in test or dev flows.

### Error Handling
- Throws `InvalidAddressError` if the `from` address is invalid.

## Common Errors

- **InvalidAddressError**  
  Thrown when a string/bytes input fails to parse as a valid 20-byte address.

- **UnreachableCodeError**  
  Thrown internally if a code path was unexpectedly reached. Generally wrapped into a more descriptive error.

## Other Handy Utilities

Some additional lower-level utility re-exports from [`@tevm/utils`](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo/tree/main/packages/utils) or [`viem`](https://viem.sh):

- `hexToBytes(hex: string): Uint8Array`  
  Convert a hex string to raw bytes (with optional size checks).
- `keccak256(data: Uint8Array | HexString, 'bytes' | 'hex')`  
  A standard [keccak256](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/security/#keccak256-and-sha-3) hasher.
- `encodeFunctionData(...)`, `toRlp(...)`, etc.  
  Various encoding helpers used by Tevm Node internally.

> **Tip:** If you are building higher-level code in the browser or Node, you may prefer [`viem`](https://viem.sh)'s standardized utilities for bytes conversions, hashing, and ABIs. Tevm re-exports many of these for convenience.
