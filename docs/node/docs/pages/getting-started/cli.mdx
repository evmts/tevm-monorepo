# Tevm CLI Quickstart

The Tevm CLI offers a powerful command-line interface to interact with Ethereum networks, local development environments, and smart contracts directly from your terminal. This guide will help you get started with the most important CLI commands.

## Installation

Install the Tevm CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g tevm
```

Or use it directly with npx:

```bash
npx tevm <command>
```

## Core Commands

Tevm CLI provides several key commands to help with Ethereum development workflows:

### 1. Project Creation

Create a new Ethereum project with the interactive CLI:

```bash
tevm create my-project
```

This launches an interactive wizard that guides you through configuring:
- Project name and location
- Framework selection (React, Vue, Vanilla, etc.)
- Use case (UI, API, testing)
- Package manager preference
- Other project settings

For non-interactive mode, specify options directly:

```bash
tevm create my-project --template react --skip-prompts
```

### 2. Running a Local Ethereum Server

Start a full-featured Ethereum JSON-RPC server with Tevm features:

```bash
tevm serve
```

This launches a server on `localhost:8545` with an interactive terminal UI for managing your node.

Options include:

```bash
# Launch on a custom port
tevm serve --port 8546

# Fork from a mainnet or testnet
tevm serve --fork https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY

# Set custom chain ID
tevm serve --chainId 1337

# Advanced logging
tevm serve --verbose --loggingLevel debug
```

The interactive server interface provides tabs for:
- Viewing server status
- Executing RPC calls
- Managing accounts
- Viewing transaction logs

### 3. Smart Contract Interaction

Execute calls against contracts with full type safety:

```bash
tevm call --to 0x123... --data 0xabcdef...
```

This command opens an interactive editor for constructing your call parameters, then executes the call against the target contract.

For direct execution without the interactive editor:

```bash
tevm call --to 0x123... --data 0xabcdef... --run
```

The `call` command supports a wide range of options for customizing your EVM execution:

```bash
# Specify gas limit, price, and value
tevm call --to 0x123... --gas 1000000 --gasPrice 1000000000 --value 1000000000000000000

# Connect to a remote node instead of local
tevm call --to 0x123... --rpc https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY

# Create a trace of the execution
tevm call --to 0x123... --createTrace
```

### 4. TypeScript Generation from Solidity

Generate TypeScript types and interfaces from Solidity contracts:

```bash
tevm generate contract
```

This command scans for all Solidity files in your project and generates corresponding TypeScript files with full type definitions, without requiring a bundler plugin.

```bash
# Generate types for specific files or patterns
tevm generate contract "ERC20Token"

# Specify input and output directories
tevm generate contract --include "contracts/**/*.sol" --output "types/"

# Force overwrite existing files
tevm generate contract --force
```

## Additional Useful Commands

Tevm CLI includes many specialized commands for specific Ethereum operations:

### Account & State Management

```bash
# Get account details
tevm getAccount --address 0x123...

# Set account state
tevm setAccount --address 0x123... --balance 1000000000000000000

# Set contract code
tevm setCode --address 0x123... --code 0x...

# Dump full state for backup/debugging
tevm dumpState --output state.json
```

### Mining & Block Control

```bash
# Mine new blocks
tevm mine --blocks 1

# Load state from a file
tevm loadState --input state.json
```

### Contract Testing

```bash
# Deploy a contract
tevm deploy --code 0x...

# Read from a contract
tevm readContract --address 0x123... --abi [...] --function "balanceOf" --args "[\"0x456...\"]"
```

## Interactive Mode

Most Tevm CLI commands support an interactive mode that launches your default editor (configurable via environment variables) with a template for the command parameters. This is especially useful for complex operations where you need to carefully construct parameters.

Disable interactive mode with the `--run` flag to execute commands directly.

## Environment Variables

The Tevm CLI supports configuration via environment variables:

```bash
# Set default RPC endpoint
export TEVM_RPC=http://localhost:8545

# Set default "from" address for transactions
export TEVM_FROM=0x123...

# Configure default editor for interactive mode
export EDITOR=code
```

## Next Steps

Now that you're familiar with the Tevm CLI basics, you can:

- [Learn about the Tevm Node API](/core/create-tevm-node)
- [Explore the Tevm bundler for importing Solidity directly](/getting-started/bundler)
- [Check out the full CLI reference](/reference/cli)
- [Run the `tevm --help` command for a complete list of available commands and options]

The Tevm CLI makes Ethereum development and testing more efficient by providing a unified interface for common operations directly from your terminal. Combined with Tevm's powerful EVM implementation, you can build, test, and deploy Ethereum applications with confidence.
