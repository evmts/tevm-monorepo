# Overview

Tevm Node is an Ethereum Node that runs in all JavaScript environments.
It's like [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/), but provides these advantages:

- Zero native dependencies (runs in browser)
- Connects directly to [`viem`](https://viem.sh/) or [`ethers`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/)
- Provides lower level control over the ethereum node

If you know how to use `viem` or `ethers`, you already know how to use Tevm Node and can get started right away.

If you don't know how to use `viem` or `ethers`, don't worry, Tevm is a great way to learn both Ethereum and TypeScript.
