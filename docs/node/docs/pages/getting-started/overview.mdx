## Getting Started

::::steps

### Install Tevm

First, install Tevm in your project:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install tevm
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add tevm
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add tevm
```

```bash [bun]
bun add tevm
```

:::

### Choose Your Client

Tevm offers different client types depending on your needs

#### In-memory client

You can spin up an empty ethereum node

```ts
import { createMemoryClient } from "tevm";

const memoryClient = createMemoryClient();
const blockNumber = await memoryClient.getBlockNumber();
```

:::details[How it works]

1. We create a `memoryClient` that runs an Ethereum node entirely in memory built with TypeScript and Wasm
2. We use the [`viem` api](https://viem.sh) to query it.
   :::

#### Fork client

You can fork an existing chain similar to Anvil and Hardhat.

```typescript
import { createMemoryClient } from "tevm";
import { http } from "viem"; // http is available in tevm package as well for convenience
import { mainnet } from "tevm/chains";

const forkClient = createMemoryClient({
  fork: {
    transport: http("https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY"),
    common: mainnet,
  },
});
```

(coming soon) You can give this client out a try right now using the Tevm CLI

```bash
bunx tevm tevmCall --rpc=https://mainnet.optimism.io
```

:::details[How it works]

1. We create a `memoryClient` like before but this time we pass in a transport
2. Tevm will fetch the latest block upon creation
3. As Tevm executes it will lazily fetch state from the fork url
4. Tevm has optimizations that make it more efficient at fetching state than alternatives like Anvil or Hardhat
   :::

#### Rebasing client (coming soon)

This powerful client will not only fork an existing chain but it will also listen for new blocks. As new blocks come in it will rebase it's state on the existing chain.

```typescript
import { createMemoryClient } from "tevm";
import { http } from "viem";
import { mainnet } from "tevm/chains";

const forkClient = createMemoryClient({
  fork: {
    transport: http("https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY"),
    common: mainnet,
    rebase: true,
  },
});
```

:::details[How it works]

1. We create a `memoryClient` like our forked client but this time we pass in `rebase: true`
2. Tevm will fork just like before
3. Tevm will update it's fork as "latest" tag changes on the forked chain making sure to efficiently invalidate any state it needs to.
   :::

#### Tree-shakable client

In addition to using `createMemoryClient` Tevm supports the Viem tree-shakable api.

```typescript
import { createClient, http } from "viem";
import { createTevmTransport } from "tevm/memory-client";
import { optimism } from "tevm/common";

const client = createClient({
  transport: createTevmTransport({
    fork: { transport: http("https://mainnet.optimism.io") },
    common: optimism,
  }),
});

// Import actions from viem
import { getBlockNumber } from "viem";

await getBlockNumber(client);
```

The tree-shakable API will not include any viem or tevm actions you aren't using. For apps running in the browser the tree-shakable client is recomended to keep bundle size minimal.

#### Ethers client

In addition to viem support Tevm plugs into Ethers as well as any other library that supports the `EIP-1193 Provider` standard.

```typescript
import { TevmProvider } from "tevm/ethers";
import { http, toHex, parseEth } from "tevm";
const provider = await TevmProvider.createMemoryProvider({
  fork: {
    transport: http("https://mainnet.optimism.io"),
  },
});
await provider.send("tevm_setAccount", [
  {
    address: `0x${"69".repeat(20)}`,
    nonce: toHex(1),
    balance: toHex(parseEth("25")),
  },
]);
```

### Use your client to read and write to an in-memory blockchain

Below is a complete typical flow of using Tevm to:

1. Add a contract to the Tevm state
2. Write to the contract with viem
3. Mine a new block with the transaction
4. Read from contract with viem

```ts showLineNumbers {1,11-13,22} filename="simple-contract.ts"
import { createMemoryClient, PREFUNDED_ACCOUNTS } from "tevm";
import { http } from "viem";
import { SimpleContract } from "tevm/contract";
import { optimism } from "tevm/common";

// Create an in-memory Ethereum client forking optimism
const client = createMemoryClient({
  common: optimism,
  fork: { transport: http("https://mainnet.optimism.io") },
});

const contract = SimpleContract.withAddress(`0x${"40".repeat(20)}`);

// Deploy contract bytecode. There are many ways to do this including tevmDeploy.
// Here we just use an anvil test action
await client.setCode({
  address: contract.address,
  bytecode: contract.deployedBytecode,
});

// Write to contract
await client.writeContract({
  account: PREFUNDED_ACCOUNTS[0],
  abi: contract.abi,
  functionName: "set",
  args: [420n],
  address: contract.address,
});

await client.tevmMine();

// Read from contract
const value = await client.readContract({
  abi: contract.abi,
  functionName: "get",
  address: contract.address,
});

console.log(value); // 420n
```

:::details[How it works]

1. We create a `memoryClient` that runs an Ethereum node entirely in memory
2. We define a contract and its address
3. We deploy the contract using `setCode` (simpler than a full deployment transaction)
4. We write to the contract using a familiar viem-style interface
5. We mine the transaction to include it in a block
6. We read the updated value from the contract
   :::

### Key Points:

- **Familiar Interface** — Tevm uses [viem](https://viem.sh) as its primary API, making it instantly familiar to viem users
- **Ethers Support** - Tevm also supports `ethers.js` as via the `EIP-1193 provider` standard
- **In-Memory Execution** — TevmNode runs the Ethereum environment directly in memory rather than using JSON-RPC over HTTP
- **Full Control** — Mine blocks on demand, manipulate state, and more
- **Cross platform** - Run your ethereum node in the browser
- **Powerful** - Comes with many advantages over an `Anvil`, `Ganache`, or `Hardhat` node

### Start Building

You're now ready to build with Tevm!

```ts
// Runs in browsers, Node.js, Deno, Bun and beyond
// Zero native dependencies
import { createMemoryClient } from "tevm";
// Optionally import solidity contracts directly into typescript in a typesafe way
// This requires the Tevm Bundler to be set up (see Bundler Quickstart)
import { ComplexSimulation } from "../contracts/ComplexSimulation.s.sol";

const client = createMemoryClient();

// Use the viem api you already know
console.log(await client.getBlockNumber());

// Or use powerful typescript native apis
const {
  data,
  error,
  logs,
  createdAddresses,
  executionGasUsed,
  l1Fee,
  trace,
  accessList,
  txHash,
} = await client.tevmContract({
  deployedBytecode: ComplexSimulation.deployedBytecode,
  ...ComplexSimulation.read.simulate(2n, "arg2"),
  createTrace: true,
  createAccessList: true,
  createTransaction: true,
  throwOnFail: false,
  onStep: (step, next) => {
    console.log(step.opcode);
    next?.();
  },
});
```

## Essential viem concepts

If you're new to Ethereum development, don't worry! Tevm serves as an excellent learning platform for both Ethereum and TypeScript:

:::info

- **Isolated Environment** — Experiment freely without worrying about network costs or confirmation times
- **TypeScript Integration** — Get full type safety and autocomplete for Ethereum interactions
- **Simple API Surface** — Focus on learning core concepts with a streamlined interface
- **Step Debugger** — Trace transaction execution at the opcode level for deep understanding
  :::

For users new to viem it is recomended you at least become [familiar with viem](https://viem.sh). But as a short introduction of the essential concepts you need to know:

- `Clients` are made with `createClient`, `createPublicClient`, `createWalletClient`, `createTestClient`, and `createMemoryClient` and are the main abstraction you interact with.
- `Actions` such as `getBlockNumber`, `call`, `readContract`, `estimateGas`, and `tevmSetAccount` are how you interact with `viem` and `tevm`
- `Transports` such as `http` and `createTevmTransport` are EIP-1193 compatable providers used to resolve JSON-RPC requests. Both `viem` and `tevm` use transports such as the `http()` transport to fetch remotely over http
- `TevmNode` itself is a transport that plugs an in-memory ethereum node into viem to resolve JSON-RPC requests
