# Getting Started with Viem

## Installation

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install tevm viem@latest
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install tevm viem@latest
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add tevm viem@latest
```

:::

## Sample code

Fork an existing blockchain and use [`viem` actions](https://viem.sh).

```ts [viem-quickstart.mts]
import {createMemoryClient, http} from 'tevm'
import {optimism} from 'tevm/common'
import {encodeFunctionData, parseAbi, decodeFunctionResult, parseEther} from 'viem'

const client = createMemoryClient({
  fork: {
    transport: http('https://mainnet.optimism.io'),
    common: optimism,
  },
})

const blockNumber = await client.getBlockNumber()
console.log(blockNumber)

const account = `0x${"baD60A7".padStart(40, "0")}` as const
const greeterContractAddress = "0x10ed0b176048c34d69ffc0712de06CbE95730748"

const greetAbi = parseAbi(['function greet() view returns (string)'])
const setGreetingAbi = parseAbi(['function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public'])

// Use viem test actions to modify the blockchain
// There are also powerful tevm actions that are prefixed with tevm like tevmSetAccount
await client.setBalance({
  address: account,
  value: parseEther("1")
})

// Read contracts using normal viem apis
const callResult = await client.readContract({
  to: greeterContractAddress,
  abi: greetAbi,
  functionName: 'greet',
})

// use writecontract to send a eth_sendRawTransaction
const writeResult = await client.writeContract({
  account,
  to: greeterContractAddress,
  abi: setGreetingAbi,
  args: [newGreeting]
  chain: optimism,
})

// mine a new block to include your tx in the blockchain
await client.mine({blocks: 1})
```

:::details[Explanation]

```ts
import {createMemoryClient, http} from 'tevm'
import {optimism} from 'tevm/common'
import {encodeFunctionData, parseAbi, decodeFunctionResult, parseEther} from 'viem'
```

Import functions we need, which will be explained when we call them.
Notice that most functions we call are from `viem`, not `tevm`.

```ts
const client = createMemoryClient({
  fork: {
    transport: http('https://mainnet.optimism.io'),
    common: optimism
  },
})

await client.tevmReady()
```

Create a client as a fork of the Optimism mainnet, and wait until it is ready.

```ts
const blockNumber = await client.getBlockNumber()
console.log(blockNumber)
```

Report the fork block number. Any changes on the Optimism mainnet after this point will not be reflected in the `tevm` client.

```ts
const account = "0x" + "baD60A7".padStart(40, "0")
const greeterContractAddress = "0x10ed0b176048c34d69ffc0712de06CbE95730748"
```

A couple of addresses. `0x0...0baD60A7` is just a random unused address which we'll use as our address.
[`0x10ed0b176048c34d69ffc0712de06CbE95730748`](https://optimism.blockscout.com/address/0x10ed0b176048c34d69ffc0712de06CbE95730748?tab=read_write_contract) is a `Greeter` contract we can use to experiment.

```ts
const greetAbi = parseAbi(['function greet() view returns (string)'])
const setGreetingAbi = parseAbi(['function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public'])
```

Use [`viem`'s `parseAbi`](https://viem.sh/docs/abi/parseAbi#parseabi) to get the ABI for the two functions we need.

```ts
const getGreeting = async () => {
  const callResult = await client.call({
    account,
    to: greeterContractAddress,
    data: encodeFunctionData({
      abi: greetAbi
    })
  })

  const greeting = decodeFunctionResult({
    abi: greetAbi,
    data: callResult.data
  })

  return greeting
}
```

This function is identical to what you would use to call an actual node using `viem` to get the greeting.

```ts
const setGreeting = async newGreeting => {
  const callResult = await client.sendTransaction({
    account,
    to: greeterContractAddress,
    data: encodeFunctionData({
      abi: setGreetingAbi,
      args: [newGreeting]
    }),
    chain: optimism
  })

  return callResult
}
```

This function is similar to what you'd use with `viem`.
Normally `viem` does not support specifying the account as an address, because it needs the private key to sign the transaction.
However, this is supported when using `viem` with a [test client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/test).

```ts
await client.setBalance({
  address: account,
  value: parseEther("1")
})
```

Mint 1 ETH for our address so we'll be able to send transactions.
The function we use is identical to [`viem`s `setBalance`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/test/setBalance#setbalance).

```ts
console.log(`Original greeting: ${await getGreeting()}`)
```

The way you get a greeting is identical to the way you'd do it with `viem`.

```ts
console.log(`Txn hash: ${await setGreeting("Hi")}`)
await client.mine({blocks: 1})
console.log(`Changed greeting: ${await getGreeting()}`)
```

Because we control the "node", we control when it mines a new block and processes transactions.
So after we use [`<client>.sendTransaction`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/wallet/sendTransaction) we need to use [`<client>.mine`](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/test/mine) for the transaction to take effect.

:::

You can also use the tree-shakeable API. See [`viem` tevm docs](../examples/viem.mdx)

## Hooking into the evm

You can watch the EVM run in real time via hooking into it when you make your calls.

```typescript
await client.tevmContract({
  abi,
  functionName,
  args,
  onStep: (stepInfo, next) => {
    console.log(stepInfo.opcode)
    next?.()
  }
})
```

This method is supported on all tevmCall methods including tevmContract, and tevmDeploy.

## Tevm actions

Some `tevm` actions are available directly in the client.
They are [tree-shakable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking), which makes them more efficient when writing code to run in a web browser.

The most common actions used are the following

- `tevmCall`, `tevmContract`, and `tevmDeploy` are used to do calls, contract calls, and deploy contracts with Tevm. These methods provide more functionality such as running a callback as the evm runs that are not supported by normal viem methods like `readContract` as well as returning more information.
- `tevmMine` Is how you mine a new block with Tevm
- `tevmSetAccount` and `tevmGetAccount` are convenient ways to update the EVM state
- `readContract`, and `writeContract` are commonly used viem methods but can be done using `tevmContract` for more advanced features such as account impersonating

Remember, all viem actions are supported.
