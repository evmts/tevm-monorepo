## Who This Section Is For

This section is designed for:

- Developers looking for practical guidance on using REVM
- Those learning through examples rather than concepts
- Developers implementing specific use cases with REVM
- Those wanting to understand how REVM is used in real-world scenarios

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this section, you should have:

- Understanding of REVM basics (from the Beginner Tutorial)
- Familiarity with Ethereum concepts
- Rust programming knowledge
- Specific domain knowledge for certain examples (e.g., DeFi protocols for advanced examples)

## How to Use These Examples

Each example is presented with:

- Context and purpose explanation
- Annotated code from the example
- Key implementation details
- Extension possibilities

You can:

- Read through the examples to understand different usage patterns
- Use them as templates for your own implementations
- Experiment by modifying the examples
- Explore different aspects of REVM functionality

The examples progressively build on each other, demonstrating increasingly complex use cases and integration patterns. We recommend starting with the first example and working your way through sequentially.

## Integration with REVM Documentation

These examples complement the other sections of the REVM documentation:

- [Beginner Tutorial](../beginner-tutorial/README.md): Provides a step-by-step introduction to REVM
- [Intermediate Concepts](../intermediate-concepts/README.md): Explains the key components and concepts of REVM
- [Expert Reference](../expert-reference/README.md): Offers detailed technical information for advanced users

The examples showcase practical applications of the concepts covered in these sections, providing real-world context for the theoretical knowledge.
