# Step 1: Documentation Hierarchy Planning - Summary

This note summarizes the findings and decisions made during Step 1 of the REVM documentation project: "Plan out the hierarchy of the docs." This step involved analyzing the REVM codebase, reviewing existing documentation, defining target audiences, creating a logical structure, establishing standards, planning section content, and developing a roadmap.

## Key Findings

### Codebase Structure Analysis

1. **Core Components**
   - REVM has a modular architecture with distinct components:
     - Execution API for running Ethereum transactions
     - EVM Framework for creating custom EVM variants
     - Context for environment and state management
     - Instructions for opcode implementation
     - Precompiles for built-in contracts
     - Inspector for tracing and debugging

2. **Crate Organization**
   - REVM is divided into multiple specialized crates:
     - Main `revm` crate that reexports other crates
     - Component-specific crates for primitives, interpreter, precompiles, etc.
     - Each crate has a distinct responsibility
     - `op-revm` demonstrates custom EVM implementation

3. **Key APIs and Interfaces**
   - Several key interfaces define REVM's behavior:
     - Execution-related traits for transaction processing
     - Context-related traits for environment management
     - Framework traits for customization
     - Inspection traits for debugging and analysis

### Existing Documentation Review

1. **Current Documentation**
   - Basic README with overview and simple examples
   - "The book" with architecture and usage information
   - Code examples demonstrating various use cases
   - Limited beginner-oriented content

2. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Lack of comprehensive beginner tutorials
   - Limited explanation of architecture and concepts
   - Incomplete API documentation
   - Few examples of common usage patterns
   - Minimal integration guidance

### Target Audience Analysis

1. **Primary Audience Segments**
   - Ethereum client developers
   - Layer 2 developers
   - Blockchain tooling developers
   - zkVM developers
   - Smart contract developers
   - Blockchain researchers

2. **Common Use Cases**
   - Basic transaction execution
   - Contract deployment and interaction
   - Custom EVM implementation
   - State forking and manipulation
   - Transaction tracing and debugging
   - Block processing and simulation
   - Custom precompile implementation

## Documentation Structure

Based on our analysis, we've designed a four-section documentation structure:

1. **Beginner Tutorial**
   - Progressive introduction to REVM
   - Step-by-step guides for common tasks
   - Basic concepts and fundamentals
   - Target audience: New users, smart contract developers

2. **Intermediate Concepts**
   - Detailed explanations of architecture and components
   - Key concepts and design decisions
   - Usage patterns and best practices
   - Target audience: Regular users, integrators, customizers

3. **REVM Examples**
   - Enhanced explanations of existing examples
   - Context, purpose, and learning objectives
   - Variations and extensions
   - Target audience: All users seeking practical guidance

4. **Expert Reference Docs**
   - Comprehensive API reference
   - Detailed component documentation
   - Advanced customization guidance
   - Target audience: Advanced users, extenders, implementers

## Documentation Standards

## Next Steps

Based on our comprehensive planning for the documentation hierarchy, the next steps are:

1. **Begin Implementation of Beginner Tutorial**
   - Start with Introduction to REVM
   - Create Getting Started guide
   - Develop Basic Transaction Execution tutorial

2. **Prepare Documentation Environment**
   - Set up directory structure
   - Implement navigation framework
   - Create templates for different document types

3. **Refine Plans Based on Implementation Experience**
   - Adjust plans as needed based on initial implementation
   - Gather early feedback
   - Refine subsequent sections based on lessons learned

With this comprehensive plan in place, we have a clear roadmap for developing high-quality, well-structured documentation for REVM that will serve the needs of all user types while maintaining the quality standards exemplified by Stripe and Vue.js documentation.
