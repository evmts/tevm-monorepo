# Summary of Step 1: Plan out the hierarchy of the docs

## Accomplishments

In Step 1, we have successfully planned the hierarchy and structure for the REVM documentation. Here's what we've accomplished:

### 1. Analysis and Research

- **Codebase Structure Analysis**: Analyzed the REVM codebase to understand its components, architecture, and capabilities.
- **Existing Documentation Review**: Reviewed existing documentation to identify gaps and areas for improvement.
- **Target Audience Analysis**: Identified key user personas and their documentation needs.
- **Use Case Mapping**: Documented common use cases and workflows.

### 2. Documentation Planning

- **Established Documentation Structure**: Created a clear four-section hierarchy for the documentation:
  - Beginner Tutorial
  - Intermediate Concepts
  - REVM Examples
  - Expert Reference Docs
- **Defined Documentation Standards**: Established writing style, formatting, and content standards.
- **Detailed Section Content**: Planned specific content for each section and subsection.
- **Created Development Roadmap**: Developed a phased approach for documentation development.

### 3. Initial Implementation

- **Created Directory Structure**: Set up the basic directory structure for the documentation.
- **Created README Files**: Added README files for the main documentation and each section.
- **Implemented Sample Document**: Created a sample document (Introduction to REVM) to demonstrate the documentation style.

### 4. Notes and Documentation

- **Created Planning Notes**: Documented our analysis, decisions, and plans in detailed note files:
  - `revm_codebase_structure_analysis.md`
  - `existing_documentation_review.md`
  - `target_audience_and_use_cases.md`
  - `documentation_structure.md`
  - `documentation_standards.md`
  - `section_content_organization.md`
  - `documentation_roadmap.md`
  - `step1_summary.md`

## Key Decisions

During this planning phase, we made several important decisions:

1. **Four-Section Structure**: Chose a four-section structure to provide progressive disclosure of complexity and serve different user needs.

2. **Emphasis Areas**: Identified key areas for special emphasis in the documentation:
   - Call interception and custom precompiles
   - Custom StateManager implementation
   - Custom blockchain data structures
   - EIP and hardfork configuration

3. **Documentation Style**: Adopted a clear, concise style inspired by Stripe and Vue.js documentation.

4. **Examples Approach**: Decided to focus on enhancing existing examples with better explanations rather than creating entirely new examples.

5. **Diagram Handling**: Chose to include descriptive text for diagrams, to be implemented visually later.

6. **Phased Development**: Planned a phased approach to documentation development, starting with foundational content.

## Next Steps

With the planning phase complete, we're ready to proceed to Step 2: "Implement Beginner tutorial". Here's how we'll approach this:

1. **Develop Introduction Section**: Complete the "Introduction to REVM" section that we've started.

2. **Create Getting Started Guide**: Develop a comprehensive guide to help users install and set up REVM.

3. **Basic Transaction Tutorial**: Create a tutorial for executing basic transactions with REVM.

4. **Smart Contract Deployment Guide**: Write a guide for deploying and interacting with smart contracts.

5. **State Management Tutorial**: Develop a tutorial for working with REVM's state model.

6. **Next Steps Guide**: Create a guide to transition users to more advanced topics.

For each of these sections, we'll follow our established documentation standards, include relevant code examples, and describe diagrams where appropriate. We'll also ensure special emphasis on the identified key areas where they're relevant to beginner content.

## Conclusion

Step 1 has provided a solid foundation for the REVM documentation project. We now have a clear understanding of the documentation needs, a well-structured plan, and initial implementation to guide our work on the remaining steps. The planning phase has been thorough and comprehensive, setting us up for success in developing high-quality documentation that will serve the needs of all REVM users.
