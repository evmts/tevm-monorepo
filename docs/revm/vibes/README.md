# REVM Documentation (Original Markdown)

This directory contains the original markdown documentation for REVM (Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine).

## Vocs Documentation Site

These markdown files have been migrated to a Vocs documentation site located at:

```
/docs/revm/
```

The Vocs site is now the primary location for the REVM documentation. This directory is kept for reference purposes but is not actively maintained.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into four main sections:

### [Beginner Tutorial](./beginner-tutorial/)

Step-by-step guides to help you get started with REVM. This section covers installation, basic usage, and fundamental concepts.

### [Intermediate Concepts](./intermediate-concepts/)

Detailed explanations of REVM's architecture, components, and key concepts for developers who want a deeper understanding.

### [REVM Examples](./revm-examples/)

Comprehensive examples demonstrating REVM's capabilities and common usage patterns, with explanations and implementation details.

### [Expert Reference Docs](./expert-reference/)

Detailed reference documentation for all aspects of REVM, designed for experienced developers building on or extending REVM.

## Updating Documentation

Please make updates to the Vocs site in the `/docs/revm/` directory instead of this one.
