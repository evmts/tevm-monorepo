# How plugin works

The evmts plugin allows developers to directly import solidity files and forge scripts in their typescript code

```typescript
import MyERC20 from "./MyERC20.sol";
import { readContract } from "@evmts/core";

const balance = await readContract(MyERC20.balanceOf, ["vitalik.eth"]);
```

- What the plugin is doing conceptually

For a more in depth technical breakdown see the [developer docs](./developer.md)

## Conceptual

When the plugin sees a solidity import it will resolve the abi and the bytecode based on the plugin setup

Before transformation

```typescript
import { MyScript } from "./MyScript.sol";
```

After transformation

```typescript
// MyScript.sol.ts
const { MyScript } = {
  MyScript: {
    version,
    _artifactPath,
    _contractPath,
    name,
    abi,
    bytecode,
  },
};
```

The typescript can then go ahead and use the artifacts however it pleases including in third party libraries like [Viem](https://todoviem) or [ethers](https://todoethers)

@evmts/core as a standard has an API where you pass around the entire contract address so the developer never needs to think about the abi or bytecode and both melt away as an implementation detail of the library.

## Plugin configuration

Under the hood evmts is using a lightly modified version of the [wagmi cli](https://wagmi.sh/cli/getting-started). It works with many projects with no additional configuration but can be custom configured via the [foundry plugin](https://wagmi.sh/cli/plugins/foundry)

These configurations tell evmts how to compile contracts using the build tool of choice. If no configuration is provided it
