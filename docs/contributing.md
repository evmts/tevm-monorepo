# Contributing to evmts

All contributions to evmts are welcome

If you want to contribute, but aren't sure where to start, you can create a new [discussion](https://github.com/evmts/evmts-monorepo/discussions).

**No contribution is too small**

**Note**

> **Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features. This includes things like adding new connectors, hooks, chains, API providers, etc.**
>
> It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create a [feature request](https://github.com/evmts/evmts-monorepo/discussions/new?category=ideas) to first discuss any API changes or significant new ideas.

// TODO make a walkthrough video
