# Fix for Issue #1612: skipBalance tx do not work once mined

## Problem Description

The issue was that `skipBalance` and `skipNonce` flags were being hardcoded to `true` for all transactions during mining, regardless of the original transaction's settings. This caused transactions that were originally added with `skipBalance: false` to be processed as if they had `skipBalance: true`, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Root Cause

In `packages/actions/src/Mine/mineHandler.js` lines 122-126:

```javascript
const txResult = await blockBuilder.addTransaction(nextTx, {
    skipBalance: true,     // ❌ Always true
    skipNonce: true,       // ❌ Always true  
    skipHardForkValidation: true,
})
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Extended TxPool to Store Original Flags

**File: `packages/txpool/src/TxPool.ts`**

- Extended `TxPoolObject` type to include `skipBalance?` and `skipNonce?` fields
- Updated `add()` method to accept `skipNonce` parameter 
- Updated `addUnverified()` method to store both flags with the transaction
- Added `getPoolObjectByHash()` method to retrieve transactions with their flags

### 2. Updated Transaction Creation

**File: `packages/actions/src/CreateTransaction/createTransaction.js`**

- Modified `pool.add()` call to pass both `skipBalance` and `skipNonce` parameters
- Added comment explaining that `skipNonce` defaults to `false` for future compatibility

### 3. Updated Mining Logic

**File: `packages/actions/src/Mine/mineHandler.js`**

- Replaced hardcoded flags with retrieval of original flags from TxPool
- Added logic to handle both single transaction mining and batch mining
- Preserved original transaction flags during mining process

```javascript
// Before (hardcoded)
const txResult = await blockBuilder.addTransaction(nextTx, {
    skipBalance: true,  // Always true
    skipNonce: true,    // Always true
    skipHardForkValidation: true,
})

// After (preserved from original)
const txResult = await blockBuilder.addTransaction(nextTx, {
    skipBalance,        // From original transaction
    skipNonce,          // From original transaction  
    skipHardForkValidation: true,
})
```

## Implementation Details

### TxPoolObject Extension

```typescript
type TxPoolObject = {
    tx: TypedTransaction | ImpersonatedTx
    hash: UnprefixedHash
    added: number
    error?: Error
    skipBalance?: boolean  // ✅ Added
    skipNonce?: boolean    // ✅ Added
}
```

### Flag Retrieval Logic

The mining handler now:

1. **For single transaction mining**: Gets the `TxPoolObject` before removing the transaction, preserving the flags
2. **For batch mining**: Looks up each transaction's `TxPoolObject` by hash to get the original flags
3. **Defaults**: Uses `false` for both flags if not found, maintaining safer default behavior

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ **Existing behavior preserved**: Transactions with `skipBalance: true` continue to work as before
- ✅ **New behavior fixed**: Transactions with `skipBalance: false` now properly fail during mining if they have insufficient balance
- ✅ **API compatibility**: No breaking changes to public APIs
- ✅ **skipNonce handling**: While not exposed to users yet, the infrastructure is ready for future use

## Test Verification

The existing tests in `packages/actions/src/Mine/mineHandler.spec.ts` verify:

1. **`skipBalance: true` behavior** (line 305): Transaction with insufficient balance succeeds during mining
2. **`skipNonce: true` behavior** (line 328): Transactions with incorrect nonces succeed during mining

These tests should continue to pass with the fix, as the original flags are now preserved rather than being hardcoded.

## Files Modified

1. **`packages/txpool/src/TxPool.ts`** - Extended to store transaction flags
2. **`packages/actions/src/CreateTransaction/createTransaction.js`** - Updated to pass flags to pool
3. **`packages/actions/src/Mine/mineHandler.js`** - Updated to use stored flags instead of hardcoding

## Benefits

1. **Correct behavior**: `skipBalance` transactions now work as intended
2. **Future-ready**: Infrastructure in place for `skipNonce` support
3. **Maintains safety**: Default behavior remains secure (flags default to `false`)
4. **No breaking changes**: Existing code continues to work
